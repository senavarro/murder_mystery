    <div id="rules">

        <ol id="ruleset">
            <li>1. Please don't share any details / comments with anyone until the Murder Mystery. Any small comment could reveal more than you think. </li>
            <li>2. Acting is key. Live your character, BE your character. </li>
            <li>3. If your character has to withhold information, hide it as you would hide your deepest secret. But if Mr.Acker (me) tells you “confess!” you have to reveal the information. </li>
            <li>4. If during the murder mystery you have any doubts or have revealed something that you shouldn’t have don’t worry. Come to me and we can sort it out. </li>
            <li>5. Feel free to add more personality to your character but please let me know first. Any alterations on the background could mess with the story. </li>
            <li>6. It is encouraged to dress up. You have total freedom to choose what your character looks like (but please try to keep it Victorian themed). </li>
            <li>7. Everything is for the show: If your character is questioned / someone is interrogating you and they are up to finding something out, help them out (within reason). Don’t look at it as winning or losing. There's no points system and there is no prize. Simply be part of the story, play along and enjoy. </li>
            <li>8. Have lots of fun :) </li>
        </ol>

    <h3>CONTEXT</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Date of the event</strong>: 26th of November, 1863.</li>
                <li><strong>Historical context</strong>: Queen Victoria is the monarch in the UK and Henry John Temple was PM. It had been 7 years (1856) since the end of the Crimean War, where Russia lost to an alliance between the Ottoman Empire, the UK, France and Sardinia-Piedmont. Darwin had already published the Theory of Evolution and it started to become popular. Abraham Lincon is president of the US and he declares the first Thanksgiving. The football association was created in England. Franz Ferdinard of Austria was born. The first section of the London underground was opened and many rails were built around the US and Europe. Divorce became allowed for citizens of all classes (not only upper class) although heavily stigmatised. </li>
                <li>The once all mighty and sovereign East India Company had fallen in 1858 after a year of the Sepoy Rebellion. This ended up with the company passing its powers to rule over the subcontinent to the United Kingdom’s monarchy, beginning the period known as the British Raj.</li>
                <li><strong>Story context</strong>: In these days fears of supernatural powers and pests are gaining popularity amongst the people, one of the most populars and is vampirism. Mr. Acker, a very wealthy and powerful man from London, put up an ad looking for vampire hunters. Apparently he has been threatened by a vampire and the local authority hasn’t been able to help him.  He offers £350 to whoever finds and kills the vampire. In today's money, it would be the equivalent of £36.000. </li>
            </ul>

    <h3>GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box right">
            <ul>
                <h4>Mr.Acker</h4>
                <li>David Acker or Mr. Acker is the son of a rich and powerful man in London’s society. His father was one of the higher ups at the East India Company until the company was nationalised. Most of the family fortune comes from the shady deal that happened when the shareholders voted to accept a pay-off for their shares. The family also has many other businesses and shares in other companies as well as board seats.
                    His father (Sir Edward Acker) died three years ago of tuberculosis. Since then the son has taken on all the businesses of the family.</li>
                <li>But Mr. Acker’s ambitions weren’t satisfied with just continuing the legacy, he wanted to be even more powerful and feared than his dad was. He started an iron factory in Birmingham to supply guns to the empire. He also acquired lots of properties around London and started importing exotic products from different regions of the world to sell them to rich european collectionists.
                    He is well connected to the UK’s government and has even some ties with the monarchy but as any powerful person, he has created many enemies along the way.
                    This time it seems like it has gone even further than a simple enemy: He has been receiving threatening notes signed with blood and letting him know that a vampire was onto him. Since then, Mr. Acker has stopped appearing in public and given the inefficiency of the police on finding the person threatening him and his family he decided to hire a team of experts along with some contacts to hunt down the vampire. </li>

                <h4>Mr.Graham</h4>
                <li>Mr.Graham is Mr.Acker’s right hand. They have worked together for many years. He is the equivalent of a dog of prey: aggressive, intimidating and feared. </li> 
                <li>He goes where Mr.Acker sends him and is in charge of getting things done and protecting Mr.Acker’s interests and honour. He has brutally beaten up more people than anyone can count and everyone is pretty sure that he has even killed. Mr.Acker always covers his tracks so he never gets in trouble. Mr.Graham is a man better not to mess with. He is a regular at many pubs but especially around Camden. </li>
            </ul>

    <h3>YOUR CHARACTER</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box">
            <ul>
                <h4>Ada Bennett - Drug dealer / perfume shop owner</h4>
                <li>Born and raised in Liverpool but moved to London looking for adventure. Money was always tight until you realised that you didn’t need to play by the rules. At a young age you discovered that people are very keen to pay A LOT of money for certain… substances. You have a perfume shop but it is just a cover to sell your “substances”. </li>
                <li>You have always thought that vampires are a myth. When you saw that Mr.Acker (a re-known man with lots of businesses) put up an ad looking for vampire experts you had an idea: What if vampires are actually real? Do they use poison to turn people? Could you extract that poison and make people feel as powerful as a vampire for a few hours under controlled effects? It was definitely worth the shot. </li>
                <li>You decided then that you would attend the meeting. To avoid getting into trouble, you will introduce yourself as a perfume seller. Your goal will be to get as much information as possible about vampires.</li>
                <li>A couple of weeks ago you heard that Mr.Acker had put an ad and a reward. Apparently he was being tormented by a vampire and needed vampire experts to help him. </li>

                <li><strong>You are not the vampire. </strong></p>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h5>Important information for your character: </h5>
                <li>- If anyone asks you questions about perfumes, be a bit suspicious. If accused of being a vampire because you are hiding information, confess the real reason you are there. </li>
                <li>You have to try to team up with other vampire experts. Talk about your great sense of smell and how easily you could find a vampire. Offer them to work together and split the reward. </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h5 class="things">Things you can say:</h5>
                <li>You own a perfume shop</li>
                <li>You have an amazing sense of smell</li>
                <li>You want to team up with someone because you don't know enough about vampires. You are willing to split the reward.</li>

                <h5>Things you can't say (unless properly questioned or found out):</h5>
                <li>- You are a drug dealer and you want to use the vampire's poison (if that is a thing) to make a new drug.</li>

            </ul>
