        <ol id="ruleset">
            <li>1. Please don't share any details / comments with anyone until the Murder Mystery. Any small comment could reveal more than you think. </li>
            <li>2. Acting is key. Live your character, BE your character. </li>
            <li>3. If your character has to withhold information, hide it as you would hide your deepest secret. But if Mr.Acker (me) tells you “confess!” you have to reveal the information. </li>
            <li>4. If during the murder mystery you have any doubts or have revealed something that you shouldn’t have don’t worry. Come to me and we can sort it out. </li>
            <li>5. Feel free to add more personality to your character but please let me know first. Any alterations on the background could mess with the story. </li>
            <li>6. It is encouraged to dress up. You have total freedom to choose what your character looks like (but please try to keep it Victorian themed). </li>
            <li>7. Everything is for the show: If your character is questioned / someone is interrogating you and they are up to finding something out, help them out (within reason). Don’t look at it as winning or losing. There's no points system and there is no prize. Simply be part of the story, play along and enjoy. </li>
            <li>8. Have lots of fun :) </li>
        </ol>

    <h3>CONTEXT</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Date of the event</strong>: 26th of November, 1863.</li>
                <li><strong>Historical context</strong>: Queen Victoria was the UK's monarch and Henry John Temple was the PM. It had been 7 years since the end of the Crimean War (1856), where Russia lost to an alliance between the Ottoman Empire, the UK, France and Sardinia-Piedmont. Darwin had already published the Theory of Evolution and it started to become popular. Abraham Lincon is the president of the US and he had declared the first Thanksgiving on that year. The football association was created in England. Franz Ferdinard of Austria was born. The first section of the London underground was opened and many rails were built around the US and Europe. Divorce became allowed for citizens of all classes (not only upper class) although heavily stigmatised. </li>
                <li>The once all mighty and sovereign East India Company had fallen in 1858 after a year of the Sepoy Rebellion. This ended up with the company passing its powers to rule over the subcontinent to the United Kingdom’s monarchy, beginning the period known as the British Raj.</li>
                <li><strong>Story context</strong>: These are strange times... weird things happen, people talk and people die mysteriously. Rumours of supernatural phenomenons and beings are taking over Europe. One of the most popular ones and is vampirism. Mr. Acker, a very wealthy and powerful man from London has put up an ad looking for vampire experts. Apparently he has been threatened by a vampire and the local authorities haven't been able to help him.  He offers £350 to whoever finds and kills the vampire. In today's money, it would be the equivalent of £36.000. </li>
            </ul>

    <h3>GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box right">
            <ul>
                <h4>Mr.Acker</h4>
                <li>David Acker or Mr. Acker is the son of a rich and powerful man in London’s society. His father was one of the higher ups at the East India Company until the company was nationalised. Most of the family fortune comes from the shady deal that happened when the shareholders voted to accept a pay-off for their shares. The family also has many other businesses and shares in other companies as well as board seats.
                    His father (Sir Edward Acker) died three years ago of tuberculosis. Since then the son has taken on all the businesses of the family.</li>
                <li>But Mr. Acker’s ambitions weren’t satisfied with just continuing the legacy, he wanted to be even more powerful and feared than his dad was. He started an iron factory in Birmingham to supply guns to the empire. He also acquired lots of properties around London and started importing exotic products from different regions of the world to sell them to rich european collectionists.
                    He is well connected to the UK’s government and has even some ties with the monarchy but as any powerful person, he has created many enemies along the way.
                    This time it seems like it has gone even further than a simple enemy: He has been receiving threatening notes signed with blood and letting him know that a vampire was onto him. Since then, Mr. Acker has stopped appearing in public and given the inefficiency of the police on finding the person threatening him and his family he decided to hire a team of experts along with some contacts to hunt down the vampire. </li>

                <h4>Mr.Graham</h4>
                <li>Mr.Graham is Mr.Acker’s right hand. They have worked together for many years. He is the equivalent of a dog of prey: aggressive, intimidating and feared. </li> 
                <li>He goes where Mr.Acker sends him and is in charge of getting things done and protecting Mr.Acker’s interests and honour. He has brutally beaten up more people than anyone can count and everyone is pretty sure that he has even killed. Mr.Acker always covers his tracks so he never gets in trouble. Mr.Graham is a man better not to mess with. He is a regular at many pubs but especially around Camden. </li>
            </ul>

    <h3>YOUR CHARACTER</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box">
            <ul>
                <h4>Adelaide Brown - Fake vampire hunter</h4>
                <li>You are an honest and hard-working woman but money has always been an issue for your family.</li>
                <li>You and your husband barely make ends meet but you are happy together and that is all that matters. You worked at a workshop that Mr.Acker owned although you never personally met him. </li>
                <li>One day, your boss, following orders from Mr.Acker, let you and all your colleagues know that your salaries would be reduced by 20% because you weren’t producing enough. You already worked 14 hours a day and did your best so you thought it wasn’t fair. When you complained to your boss he didn’t listen so you decided to write a letter to Mr.Acker asking him to reconsider. </li>
                <li>Mr.Acker replied with a letter telling you that he is planning to open a pub where ladies keep company to lonely men and that if you are interested in making more money, feel free apply “as long as you are not hideous” and to not worry as you wouldn’t have to touch them “unless you wanted to”, it was just to serve them drinks and tease them so they spend more money. You feel so outraged and dishonoured that you start trying to find a way to get back to him.  No one should get away with treating people like that. </li>
                <li>You want to get closer to Mr. Acker so you can find a way to hurt him for what he has done to your family but you don’t want to be spotted. To avoid him recognising you, you will pretend to be a vampire hunter. To prepare yourself you read a lot about vampires. </li>
                <li>If someone knows about vampires, it’s probably the church so you visited the vicar Oscar Watson to get more information. You went to him and took notes of everything he said about vampires although he didn’t know much other than the fact that if they exist they are creatures of Satan and they must fear God. </li>
                <li>When you were talking to him, a man entered the church, broke a few chairs and grabbed the vicar by the neck. He whispered something but you were unsure of what he said. The violent man then left. After making sure the vicar was ok, you also left to continue learning about vampires. </li>
                <li>In today's meeting it will be your chance to find out more about Mr.Acker and the people there and find a way to hurt him. Maybe even siding with the vampire once you find them could be a good idea so you don’t have to get your hands dirty. You are a very convincing person so you are sure you can make the vampire listen to you. You just have to find it before anyone else kills it. </li>
                <li><strong>You are not the vampire. </strong></p>
            </ul>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>Nathaniel Cage</strong>: is a famous actor but you have never been able to see a play because you couldn’t afford it. You just have heard the name. </li>

            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h5 class="things">Things you can say:</h5>

                <li>- You saw vicar Watson get threatened by Mr.Graham but you don’t know why exactly because you couldn’t hear it. </li>
                <li>- As soon as someone is accused of being a vampire, you have to claim to be a vampire hunter and try to scare them with a cross or silver. You can also suggest other ideas you might come up with. </li>
