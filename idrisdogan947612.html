    <h3>CONTEXT</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Date of the event</strong>: 26th of November, 1863.</li>
                <li><strong>Historical context</strong>: Queen Victoria was the UK's monarch and Henry John Temple was the PM. It had been 7 years since the end of the Crimean War (1856), where Russia lost to an alliance between the Ottoman Empire, the UK, France and Sardinia-Piedmont. Darwin had already published the Theory of Evolution and it started to become popular. Abraham Lincon is the president of the US and he had declared the first Thanksgiving on that year. The football association was created in England. Franz Ferdinard of Austria was born. The first section of the London underground was opened and many rails were built around the US and Europe. Divorce became allowed for citizens of all classes (not only upper class) although heavily stigmatised. </li>
                <li>The once all mighty and sovereign East India Company had fallen in 1858 after a year of the Sepoy Rebellion. This ended up with the company passing its powers to rule over the subcontinent to the United Kingdom’s monarchy, beginning the period known as the British Raj.</li>
                <li><strong>Story context</strong>: These are strange times... weird things happen, people talk and people die mysteriously. Rumours of supernatural phenomenons and beings are taking over Europe. One of the most popular ones and is vampirism. Mr. Acker, a very wealthy and powerful man from London has put up an ad looking for vampire experts. Apparently he has been threatened by a vampire and the local authorities haven't been able to help him.  He offers £350 to whoever finds and kills the vampire. In today's money, it would be the equivalent of £36.000. </li>
            </ul>

    <h3>GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box right">
            <ul>
                <h4>Mr.Acker</h4>
                <li>David Acker or Mr. Acker is the son of a rich and powerful man in London’s society. His father was one of the higher ups at the East India Company until the company was nationalised. Most of the family fortune comes from the shady deal that happened when the shareholders voted to accept a pay-off for their shares. The family also has many other businesses and shares in other companies as well as board seats.
                    His father (Sir Edward Acker) died three years ago of tuberculosis. Since then the son has taken on all the businesses of the family.</li>
                <li>But Mr. Acker’s ambitions weren’t satisfied with just continuing the legacy, he wanted to be even more powerful and feared than his dad was. He started an iron factory in Birmingham to supply guns to the empire. He also acquired lots of properties around London and started importing exotic products from different regions of the world to sell them to rich european collectionists.
                    He is well connected to the UK’s government and has even some ties with the monarchy but as any powerful person, he has created many enemies along the way.
                    This time it seems like it has gone even further than a simple enemy: He has been receiving threatening notes signed with blood and letting him know that a vampire was onto him. Since then, Mr. Acker has stopped appearing in public and given the inefficiency of the police on finding the person threatening him and his family he decided to hire a team of experts along with some contacts to hunt down the vampire. </li>

                <h4>Mr.Graham</h4>
                <li>Mr.Graham is Mr.Acker’s right hand. They have worked together for many years. He is the equivalent of a dog of prey: aggressive, intimidating and feared. </li> 
                <li>He goes where Mr.Acker sends him and is in charge of getting things done and protecting Mr.Acker’s interests and honour. He has brutally beaten up more people than anyone can count and everyone is pretty sure that he has even killed. Mr.Acker always covers his tracks so he never gets in trouble. Mr.Graham is a man better not to mess with. He is a regular at many pubs but especially around Camden. </li>

    <h3>YOUR CHARACTER</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box">
            <ul>
                <h4>Idris Dogan - Vampire hunter</h4>
                <li>You know very well that vampires are real because you have pulled fangs out of their mouths and seen what they do to their victims. You have fought at least a hundred of them and not only survived them all, but also killed most of them. </li>
                <li>Born and raised in Kostantiniyye (Istanbul), when you were 9 your family (father, mother and sister) was brutally murdered in front of you by a vampire but you managed to escape by jumping out of the window and screaming for help in the street. After that you were forced to live as a homeless orphan, stealing and fighting to survive, but also training to become stronger and be able to kill vampires. You researched and tracked down vampires, investigating crime scenes and learning more and more about them. Once you were 16 and strong enough, you started hunting them down. Your journey as a vampire hunter took you across Eastern and Central Europe. You were around the Crimean War but you didn’t fight there. Wars tend to attract vampires that feed on easy prey like wounded soldiers left behind in battlefields. That makes it easier for you to find them, hence why you tend to be around battlefields. </li>
                <li>8 years ago you arrived in London from Crimea chasing a vampire.  The vampire that you were tracking was a particularly dangerous specimen that escaped you several times and you decided to follow wherever he went. Once you tracked him down in London, you followed him and saw him attack a man in Primrose Hill but you managed to kill the vampire right before he killed the victim. The man, brutally beaten up by the vampire, was a risk to you since he could turn into a vampire (he didn’t seem bitten but better to not take any chances). When you were about to finish him, you heard a man shout and people came to his rescue. You grabbed the vampire’s body and ran to hide in the bushes and saw him get taken to the hospital (Greenwich hospital). Since you couldn’t take any chances on him turning you had to kill him. </li>
                <li>Once you got rid of the vampire’s body, you tried sneaking into the hospital to kill the possible vampire but his wife was always there. You never entered the room so you never got to see her, the doctors would just tell you that the man had accompanied already. You had then to trace a more elaborate plan: you followed the man’s doctor (a young woman) and left a book in her table about a new natural remedy that helps lower fever and fight infection. It was technically a good remedy but a bigger amount could lead to the patient suffering a paralysis in his respiratory system.  You wrote in the book the right dose. A few days after the patient was under the treatment, you managed to sneak in at night and overdosed him. It then looked like the doctor had made a mistake with the last dose and accidentally killed the patient. You killed him without leaving any trace and no one would investigate that crime. </li>
                <li>London was such a big city that the possibility of finding vampires here was always big. You decided to come more often.  </li>
                <li>You started following the rich man, Mr.Acker, to have more information. Vampires stalk their victims before they kill them whenever they have a specific target in mind. </li>
                <li>A few nights ago you came across a vampire that was following him and was in his garden. Before killing the vampire, she confessed that the ad that Mr.Acker had put up attracted the attention of several vampires. One of them said that they would go to that meeting 100% since they wanted to kill Mr.Acker. And on top of that, why not have a feast with the rest of the attendants? She didn’t give you any clues about who the vampire was or what they looked like.</li>
                <li>Since then, you also started following the closest people to Mr.Acker.  Mr. Graham was his second in command at the company and was particularly suspicious: after gathering some intel from your sources in London you discovered that he was seeing another person every Thursday night in a dark corner of a pub in Camden. They would chat for around an hour each time, exchange documents and Mr. Graham would always leave first. After 10 minutes, the other person would leave. </li>
                <li>Last night (the night before the meeting with Mr. Acker) you followed Mr.Graham home after a visit to the pub, but this time the meeting lasted only 20 minutes. Once Mr.Graham arrived home, you were ready to leave but then had a strange feeling, it’s an instinct that you develop once you have been hunting for a long time.</li>
                <li>You stayed in a corner near the house watching Mr. Graham’s window in silence. After 2 hours, you saw the mysterious person climbing up to Mr.Graham’s window and entering his apartment. A few minutes later, the person climbed down again and ran away. You hesitated but knowing how sneaky they were and that the vampire would be in the vampire expert’s meeting anyway, you decided to let them go. You went up to Mr.Graham’s room climbing the same window. You found him dead in his bed. No signs of violence. He died peacefully in his bed but with fang marks on his neck. But it was strange… the fang marks were too small for a vampire and there was no blood around them. It was all too clean, there was no way that that was the job of a vampire. </li>
                <li>You left the property making sure you weren’t seen but not without leaving a note to warn Mr.Acker and the people at the meeting: “There will be a vampire among the attendants tomorrow, Mr.Acker”. You wanted him to know.  You didn’t do it because you care, but because you wanted everyone on the edge and doing your job for you: finding out who the real vampire is.  </li>
                <li><strong>You are not the vampire. </strong></p>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h5>Important information for your character: </h5>
                <li>- They don’t have supernatural abilities like turning into bats, super strength, invisibility etc. They are normal humans but without any inhibition, meaning that they will use all their strength to kill even if that means hurting themselves.  </li>
                <li>- Vampires in the wild kill you as soon as they have the chance. In places like cities or near where they live they need to lay low and cover their tracks so they can continue hunting in the same environment for as long as possible. </li>
                <li>- Vampires don’t look different from other people except when they haven’t eaten for a long time. Then they look really pale, weak and their eyes are injected with blood. They can hide their fangs (they are retractile). </li>
                <li>- Vampires don’t convert every victim. It seems like they can choose when to segregate a substance that through their nails and fangs infects the victim with vampirism. </li>
                <li>- Vampires don’t die in the sun. They just don’t like it and it gives them a migraine. They prefer the dark and also it works much better for them to hunt in the dark. </li>
                <li>- Religious symbols and prayers don't hurt vampires.</li>
                <li>- They can be killed by stabbing them in the heart or cutting their heads</li>
                <li>- They are not allergic to garlic nor silver. </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h5 class="things">Your relationship with other characters: </h5>
                <li><strong>Mr.Graham</strong>: he is the right hand of Mr.Acker. He died in very strange circumstances but it’s quite likely that nobody knows yet at the meeting. Better to not say anything. </li>
                <li><strong>Mr.Acker</strong>: a very wealthy and well connected man but with a terrible reputation. </li>
                <li><strong>Oscar Watson</strong>: You recognise him as one of the men who saw you at Primrose Hill right after killing the vampire and before you tried to kill the drunk man. Better try to avoid him. </li>
                <li><strong>Gilbert Moore</strong>: He does look an awful lot like the man who sold you the poison to kill the man that got attacked in Primrose Hill. He has aged but you are quite sure it's him.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h5 class="things">Things you can say:</h5>
                <li>- You are a vampire hunter and you have in fact killed a lot of them. </li>
                <li>- You have been in London a few times, killing vampires.  </li>
                <li>- You came to London for the first time to kill a very clever vampire. You managed to catch him in Primrose Hill 8 years ago (only if asked about the subject or Gilbert Moore recognises you). </li>
                <li>- If anyone asks, you know that Edwin lost his son, and also that his wife ran away, but always defend his innocence if anyone accuses him. Lads have to have each other's backs. Also you don’t want to fuck around with a vampire.</li>


                <h5>Things you can't say (unless properly questioned or found out):</h5>
                <li>- You know that it wasn’t a vampire that killed Mr.Graham.</li>
                <li>- You don’t care about anyone there, you just want to kill the vampire.</li>
                <li>- You were at Mr.Graham’s house last night.</li>
                <li>- You have been following Mr.Acker and people close to him.</li>
