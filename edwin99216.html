        <ol id="ruleset">
            <li>1. Please don't share any details / comments with anyone until the Murder Mystery. Any small comment could reveal more than you think. </li>
            <li>2. Acting is key. Live your character, BE your character. </li>
            <li>2. If your character has to withhold information, hide it as you would hide your deepest secret. But if Mr.Acker (me) tells you “confess!” you have to reveal the information. </li>
            <li>3. If during the murder mystery you have any doubts or have revealed something that you shouldn’t have don’t worry. Come to me and we can sort it out. </li>
            <li>4. Feel free to add more personality to your character but please let me know first. Any alterations on the background could mess with the story. </li>
            <li>5. It is encouraged to dress up. You have total freedom to choose what your character looks like (but please try to keep it Victorian themed). </li>
            <li>6. Everything is for the show: If your character is questioned / someone is interrogating you and they are up to finding something out help them out (within reason). Don’t look at it as winning or losing. It’s not a points system and there is no price. Simply be part of the story, play along and enjoy. </li>
            <li>7. Have lots of fun :) </li>
        </ol>

    <h3>CONTEXT</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Date of the event</strong>: 26th of November, 1863.</li>
                <li><strong>Historical context</strong>: Queen Victoria is the monarch in the UK and Henry John Temple was PM. It had been 7 years (1856) since the end of the Crimean War, where Russia lost to an alliance between the Ottoman Empire, the UK, France and Sardinia-Piedmont. Darwin had already published the Theory of Evolution and it started to become popular. Abraham Lincon is president of the US and he declares the first Thanksgiving. The football association was created in England. Franz Ferdinard of Austria was born. The first section of the London underground was opened and many rails were built around the US and Europe. Divorce became allowed for citizens of all classes (not only upper class) although heavily stigmatised. </li>
                <li>The once all mighty and sovereign East India Company had fallen in 1858 after a year of the Sepoy Rebellion. This ended up with the company passing its powers to rule over the subcontinent to the United Kingdom’s monarchy, beginning the period known as the British Raj.</li>
                <li><strong>Story context</strong>: In these days fears of supernatural powers and pests are gaining popularity amongst the people, one of the most populars and is vampirism. Mr. Acker, a very wealthy and powerful man from London, put up an ad looking for vampire hunters. Apparently he has been threatened by a vampire and the local authority hasn’t been able to help him.  He offers £350 to whoever finds and kills the vampire. In today's money, it would be the equivalent of £36.000. </li>
            </ul>

    <h3>GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box right">
            <ul>
                <h4>Mr.Acker</h4>
                <li>David Acker or Mr. Acker is the son of a rich and powerful man in London’s society. His father was one of the higher ups at the East India Company until the company was nationalised. Most of the family fortune comes from the shady deal that happened when the shareholders voted to accept a pay-off for their shares. The family also has many other businesses and shares in other companies as well as board seats.
                    His father (Sir Edward Acker) died three years ago of tuberculosis. Since then the son has taken on all the businesses of the family.</li>
                <li>But Mr. Acker’s ambitions weren’t satisfied with just continuing the legacy, he wanted to be even more powerful and feared than his dad was. He started an iron factory in Birmingham to supply guns to the empire. He also acquired lots of properties around London and started importing exotic products from different regions of the world to sell them to rich european collectionists.
                    He is well connected to the UK’s government and has even some ties with the monarchy but as any powerful person, he has created many enemies along the way.
                    This time it seems like it has gone even further than a simple enemy: He has been receiving threatening notes signed with blood and letting him know that a vampire was onto him. Since then, Mr. Acker has stopped appearing in public and given the inefficiency of the police on finding the person threatening him and his family he decided to hire a team of experts along with some contacts to hunt down the vampire. </li>

                <h4>Mr.Graham</h4>
                <li>Mr.Graham is Mr.Acker’s right hand. They have worked together for many years. He is the equivalent of a dog of prey: aggressive, intimidating and feared. </li> 
                <li>He goes where Mr.Acker sends him and is in charge of getting things done and protecting Mr.Acker’s interests and honour. He has brutally beaten up more people than anyone can count and everyone is pretty sure that he has even killed. Mr.Acker always covers his tracks so he never gets in trouble. Mr.Graham is a man better not to mess with. He is a regular at many pubs but especially around Camden. </li>
            </ul>

    <h3>YOUR CHARACTER</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box">
            <ul>
                <h4>Edwin Davies - Factory worker and vampire</h4>
                <li>Born and raised in the lap of a very low working class in Deritend, an area in Birmingham. Your life has never been anything special. You went to school, were an average student, had some friends, did some sports and once you were old enough you started working in iron factories. Then you proposed to a pretty neighbour of yours and got married. Had a kid and your life revolved around providing for your family. </li>
                <li>That would pretty much be it, the life of a common man, with all the goods and bads. Until bad luck hit hard in the household: your kid got a really bad cold. </li>
                <li>You went to the doctors but you couldn’t afford proper care and none of them would help you. The hospital was collapsed with kids with smallpox so you couldn’t take your son there. You went to your boss to beg for money in advance so you could pay for private care for your son but the request was denied: “sorry Davies, if you want money you can start working harder and longer”. And you did, but more money never came. Your son passed away at the age of two. A death that could so easily have been prevented. That broke you as a man. You started telling yourself that your job was taking care of your family and you had failed. You started drinking, and drinking led to debt, and debt led to even more troubles with your partner, who eventually ran away with another man. </li>
                <li>You were all by yourself, alone and miserable and your hate for other people started to grow. You hated the world but above all those guilty of your son’s death: Mr.Acker and his people. You wanted vengeance but you didn’t know how. A man can’t fight an empire.  </li>
                <li>One day you started hearing rumours about the local gang killing a vampire. “A vampire…? Are they even real? If they are, they must be pretty strong, and hard to find… they kill people right?”. And so your curiosity was awakened.  </li>
                <li>You started looking around for more information about vampires. Only after a couple of nights of asking around and wandering the streets alone, a woman approached you. She asked you why you were looking for a vampire. “I want to become one”, you said. “There are people I need to kill. I am already dead, might as well take them with me to hell”.  Convinced by your answer, the woman revealed herself as a vampire. You offered your neck and the last thing you remember from that encounter is her bite. </li>
                <li>You woke up a bit later. It was still dark. Your body didn’t hurt anymore, all the pain of years of working in the factories was gone. So it was the effect of the alcohol in your organs. You felt… fresh and well. Better than ever before. </li>
                <li>Next to you there was a note, from the vampire you assumed. That note explained everything you needed to know.  </li>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>- You will not have super strength but you will be stronger than the average man.</em></li>
                    <li><em>- You will neither turn into a bat. But you will heal faster and feel more agile.</em> </li>
                    <li><em>- You will only be able to feed yourself from human blood. Anything else will make you weaker with time.</em> </li>
                    <li><em>- You will not die in the sun, but it will give you a headache.</em></li>
                    <li><em>- If you don’t eat regularly, you will lose control and kill anyone in front of you. And you won’t regain control until you have eaten enough.</em> </li>
                    <li><em>Enjoy your vengeance. Kill them all.</em> </li>
                </ul>
                <li>It didn't take long to find another perk: now you could tell apart humans from… let's say non-humans. The smell felt different and something in their bodies just sounded different in general. The next night you identified another vampire around the area. It was a woman in her 40s. After talking to her and sharing your experiences and how you were turned, you told her about your plan to kill Mr.Acker. </li>
                <li>Now you were ready to pay a visit to all those who had destroyed your life. Starting from the head, to avoid him escaping: Mr.Acker. You have been feeding on a couple of victims these past days so you are all ready to go. </li>
                <li><strong>You are the vampire! </strong></p>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                    <h5>Important information for your character: </h5>
                    <li>- You have never met Mr.Graham personally nor have been involved with him. You have not been sending any threatening notes to anyone either. As far as you know Mr.Acker is having problems with another vampire. If it is discovered that you are a vampire you have to state that you have not been involved at all with Mr.Graham (this will make sense on the day of the murder mystery).</li>
                    <li>- Your mission today is to avoid being discovered as the vampire and spread confusion and accusations. You choose how you prefer to do it (subtle, leading accusations, jumping on accusations, not engaging etc.) </li>
                    <li>- Towards the end, when it's clear what happened you will need to try to convince everyone that Mr.Acker has to go down. You could try to frame him or find a way to make him pay.</li>
                </ul>
            <ul>
                <h5 class="things">Your relationship with other characters: </h5>
                <li><strong>Victor Shaw</strong>: You are mates and have known each other for most of your lifes. You worked together at the guns factory until he was fired. Mr.Acker cut personnel and increased everyone’s working hours for the same amount of money. </li>
                <li><strong>Jack Cooper and Eliza Evans</strong>: They are the leaders of the local gang. They are really violent and run many illegitimate businesses. </li>
                <li><strong>Mr.Acker</strong>: You hate his guts and want to kill him, but you need to pretend until you have your opportunity. </li>
                <li><strong>Mr.Graham</strong>: You know about the man and have seen him at the factory but you have never had any interaction with him. He is Mr.Acker’s second in command but lately there has been rumours that he wants to sack him. A very violent and unpredictable man. </li>

            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h5 class="things">Things you can say:</h5>
                <li>- You know Victor Shaw from Birmingham. You are mates and he used to work at the guns factory as well. He got fired quite recently.  </li>
                <li>- You know Jack Cooper & Eliza Evans. They lead a gang in Birmingham and you’ve heard that they killed a vampire quite recently.</li>
                <li>- You have heard the rumour that Mr.Graham was going to get fired.</li>


                <h5>Things you can't say (unless properly questioned or found out):</h5>
                <li>- You lost your son and your wife. </li>
                <li>- You want to kill Mr.Acker. </li>
                <li>- You are the vampire. </li>
