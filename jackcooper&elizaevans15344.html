    <div id="rules">
        <h3 class="rules-title">IMPORTANT RULES:</h3>
        <ol id="ruleset">
            <li>1. Acting is key. Live your character, BE your character. </li>
            <li>2. If your character has to withhold information, hide it as you would hide your deepest secret. But if Mr.Acker (me) tells you “confess!” you have to reveal the information. </li>
            <li>3. If during the murder mystery you have any doubts or have revealed something that you shouldn’t have don’t worry. Come to me and we can sort it out. </li>
            <li>4. Feel free to add more personality to your character but please let me know first. Any alterations on the background could mess with the story. </li>
            <li>5. It is encouraged to dress up. You have total freedom to choose what your character looks like (but please try to keep it Victorian themed). </li>
            <li>6. Everything is for the show: If your character is questioned / someone is interrogating you and they are up to finding something out help them out (within reason). Don’t look at it as winning or losing. It’s not a points system and there is no price. Simply be part of the story, play along and enjoy. </li>
            <li>7. Have lots of fun :) </li>
        </ol>

    <h3>CONTEXT</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Date of the event</strong>: 26th of November, 1863.</li>
                <li><strong>Historical context</strong>: Queen Victoria is the monarch in the UK and Henry John Temple was PM. It had been 7 years (1856) since the end of the Crimean War, where Russia lost to an alliance between the Ottoman Empire, the UK, France and Sardinia-Piedmont. Darwin had already published the Theory of Evolution and it started to become popular. Abraham Lincon is president of the US and he declares the first Thanksgiving. The football association was created in England. Franz Ferdinard of Austria was born. The first section of the London underground was opened and many rails were built around the US and Europe. Divorce became allowed for citizens of all classes (not only upper class) although heavily stigmatised. </li>
                <li>The once all mighty and sovereign East India Company had fallen in 1858 after a year of the Sepoy Rebellion. This ended up with the company passing its powers to rule over the subcontinent to the United Kingdom’s monarchy, beginning the period known as the British Raj.</li>
                <li><strong>Story context</strong>: In these days fears of supernatural powers and pests are gaining popularity amongst the people, one of the most populars and is vampirism. Mr. Acker, a very wealthy and powerful man from London, put up an ad looking for vampire hunters. Apparently he has been threatened by a vampire and the local authority hasn’t been able to help him.  He offers £350 to whoever finds and kills the vampire. In today's money, it would be the equivalent of £36.000. </li>
            </ul>

    <h3>GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box right">
            <ul>
                <h4>Mr.Acker</h4>
                <li>David Acker or Mr. Acker is the son of a rich and powerful man in London’s society. His father was one of the higher ups at the East India Company until the company was nationalised. Most of the family fortune comes from the shady deal that happened when the shareholders voted to accept a pay-off for their shares. The family also has many other businesses and shares in other companies as well as board seats.
                    His father (Sir Edward Acker) died three years ago of tuberculosis. Since then the son has taken on all the businesses of the family.</li>
                <li>But Mr. Acker’s ambitions weren’t satisfied with just continuing the legacy, he wanted to be even more powerful and feared than his dad was. He started an iron factory in Birmingham to supply guns to the empire. He also acquired lots of properties around London and started importing exotic products from different regions of the world to sell them to rich european collectionists.
                    He is well connected to the UK’s government and has even some ties with the monarchy but as any powerful person, he has created many enemies along the way.
                    This time it seems like it has gone even further than a simple enemy: He has been receiving threatening notes signed with blood and letting him know that a vampire was onto him. Since then, Mr. Acker has stopped appearing in public and given the inefficiency of the police on finding the person threatening him and his family he decided to hire a team of experts along with some contacts to hunt down the vampire. </li>

                <h4>Mr.Graham</h4>
                <li>Mr.Graham is Mr.Acker’s right hand. They have worked together for many years. He is the equivalent of a dog of prey: aggressive, intimidating and feared. </li> 
                <li>He goes where Mr.Acker sends him and is in charge of getting things done and protecting Mr.Acker’s interests and honour. He has brutally beaten up more people than anyone can count and everyone is pretty sure that he has even killed. Mr.Acker always covers his tracks so he never gets in trouble. Mr.Graham is a man better not to mess with. He is a regular at many pubs but especially around Camden. </li>

    <h3>YOUR CHARACTER</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box">
            <ul>
                <h4>Jack Cooper and Eliza Evans - Leaders of a criminal gang</h4>
                <li>Born and raised in the streets of Small Heath, Birmingham. You are made of the same steel that the factories produce. Life isn’t kind for those born in poverty but you weren’t going to just give up. If you like something, just get it, and if someone tries to stop you, just knock their teeths out. </li>
                <li>You are childhood friends, grew up next to each other and from a very young age you've had a talent for leading. Jack’s dad was an alcoholic wife-beater who would not have any mercy on his son either. His mum died when he was ten after Jack’s dad threw her downstairs.  </li>
                <li>Eliza lost her two older brothers to smallpox when she was five. Her parents fell into depression and started using opium as a method for coping. Since they were often unable to take care of her, Eliza started fending off for herself stealing food and clothes.</li>
                <li>She used to hang out with Jack a lot and they both became family for each other, the family that neither of them had. Both grew up constantly in trouble with neighbours, other kids and the law, but nothing ever stopped them. Other kids from the neighbourhood started following them and that is how their little gang started.  </li>
                <li>When he was fifteen Jack killed his dad after an argument by punching him repeatedly until his broken fist could not punch any more. It was then when he realised that there were no limits to what he could do. He was a free man, and everything else around him was free to take for those who were strong enough. </li>
                <li>Eliza’s parents tried to force her to marry the son of a small business owner. She hated the idea of getting married as she thought that it would end up like it did for her parents: in absolute misery and drugs. To put an end to their insistence, she cut the man’s manhood and left it in her parents living room. That was the last time she saw her blood relatives. </li>
                <li>Jack and Eliza’s gang has been growing. Everyone knows of their reputation and strength. Every day more people follow their orders to escape from a miserable life. </li>
                <li>Nowadays you have moved from stealing. The business is organised gambling , business “protection” (you make them pay or you will burn the business down and trafficking guns that you get from the gun factory thanks to greased palms. You also own pubs around Birmingham and the police are in your pocket. </li>
                <li>Or they were… Until this posh idiot from London bought the guns factory in the city. In order to keep the city safe, he paid the police more to stop any trouble and bribing is way more difficult now. Since then making business has become a bit more troublesome and revenue has gone down. </li>
                <li>Are you going to let that stop you? Absolutely not. </li>
                <li>You were thinking about going down to London and break the man’s legs when you saw an ad that the same Mr.Acker put up in the newspaper looking for vampire hunters. </li>
                <li>“This could actually make the job much easier” you thought. You get close enough to the man so you can “make him reason” but also… look at how much money he is offering to get that vampire. Are vampires even real? Well, any cunt with broken teeth could be presented as a vampire and get you the big reward right?</li>
                <li>So those are your priorities, get to London, find the vampire and once you get your reward, “convince” Mr.Acker to let you do your business in Birmingham… or else. </li>
                <li>The ad specifically asked for vampire experts so you made up a story of you beating a vampire to death. That should be enough to qualify as a vampire expert, right?</li>
                <li>Right before you went to London, a couple of days ago, a very drunk lad entered one of your pubs claiming that his friend had been killed by a vampire. Your men followed him, curious but when they got to the place there wasn’t anyone there. The drunk bastard probably just made it up. </li>
                <li><strong>You are not the vampire. </strong></li>
            </ul>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>Victor Shaw</strong>: He used to work at the guns factory until recently. A working class man who recently lost his job because of this Mr.Acker being miserable and cutting down the number of workers and increasing the amount of hours of work per day.  </li>
                <li><strong>Edwin Davies</strong>: He works at the guns factory and was lucky enough to keep his job. He is a common lad but with terrible luck: He had recently lost his two year old son. He couldn’t afford a doctor.  </li>
