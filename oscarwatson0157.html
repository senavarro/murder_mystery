        <ol id="ruleset">
            <li>1. Please don't share any details / comments with anyone until the Murder Mystery. Any small comment could reveal more than you think. </li>
            <li>2. Acting is key. Live your character, BE your character. </li>
            <li>3. If your character has to withhold information, hide it as you would hide your deepest secret. But if Mr.Acker (me) tells you “confess!” you have to reveal the information. </li>
            <li>4. If during the murder mystery you have any doubts or have revealed something that you shouldn’t have don’t worry. Come to me and we can sort it out. </li>
            <li>5. Feel free to add more personality to your character but please let me know first. Any alterations on the background could mess with the story. </li>
            <li>6. It is encouraged to dress up. You have total freedom to choose what your character looks like (but please try to keep it Victorian themed). </li>
            <li>7. Everything is for the show: If your character is questioned / someone is interrogating you and they are up to finding something out, help them out (within reason). Don’t look at it as winning or losing. There's no points system and there is no prize. Simply be part of the story, play along and enjoy. </li>
            <li>8. Have lots of fun :) </li>

    <h3>CONTEXT</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Date of the event</strong>: 26th of November, 1863.</li>
                <li><strong>Historical context</strong>: Queen Victoria was the UK's monarch and Henry John Temple was the PM. It had been 7 years since the end of the Crimean War (1856), where Russia lost to an alliance between the Ottoman Empire, the UK, France and Sardinia-Piedmont. Darwin had already published the Theory of Evolution and it started to become popular. Abraham Lincon is the president of the US and he had declared the first Thanksgiving on that year. The football association was created in England. Franz Ferdinard of Austria was born. The first section of the London underground was opened and many rails were built around the US and Europe. Divorce became allowed for citizens of all classes (not only upper class) although heavily stigmatised. </li>
                <li>The once all mighty and sovereign East India Company had fallen in 1858 after a year of the Sepoy Rebellion. This ended up with the company passing its powers to rule over the subcontinent to the United Kingdom’s monarchy, beginning the period known as the British Raj.</li>
                <li><strong>Story context</strong>: These are strange times... weird things happen, people talk and people die mysteriously. Rumours of supernatural phenomenons and beings are taking over Europe. One of the most popular ones and is vampirism. Mr. Acker, a very wealthy and powerful man from London has put up an ad looking for vampire experts. Apparently he has been threatened by a vampire and the local authorities haven't been able to help him.  He offers £350 to whoever finds and kills the vampire. In today's money, it would be the equivalent of £36.000. </li>
            </ul>

    <h3>GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box right">
            <ul>
                <h4>Mr.Acker</h4>
                <li>David Acker or Mr. Acker is the son of a rich and powerful man in London’s society. His father was one of the higher ups at the East India Company until the company was nationalised. Most of the family fortune comes from the shady deal that happened when the shareholders voted to accept a pay-off for their shares. The family also has many other businesses and shares in other companies as well as board seats.
                    His father (Sir Edward Acker) died three years ago of tuberculosis. Since then the son has taken on all the businesses of the family.</li>
                <li>But Mr. Acker’s ambitions weren’t satisfied with just continuing the legacy, he wanted to be even more powerful and feared than his dad was. He started an iron factory in Birmingham to supply guns to the empire. He also acquired lots of properties around London and started importing exotic products from different regions of the world to sell them to rich european collectionists.
                    He is well connected to the UK’s government and has even some ties with the monarchy but as any powerful person, he has created many enemies along the way.
                    This time it seems like it has gone even further than a simple enemy: He has been receiving threatening notes signed with blood and letting him know that a vampire was onto him. Since then, Mr. Acker has stopped appearing in public and given the inefficiency of the police on finding the person threatening him and his family he decided to hire a team of experts along with some contacts to hunt down the vampire. </li>

                <h4>Mr.Graham</h4>
                <li>Mr.Graham is Mr.Acker’s right hand. They have worked together for many years. He is the equivalent of a dog of prey: aggressive, intimidating and feared. </li> 
                <li>He goes where Mr.Acker sends him and is in charge of getting things done and protecting Mr.Acker’s interests and honour. He has brutally beaten up more people than anyone can count and everyone is pretty sure that he has even killed. Mr.Acker always covers his tracks so he never gets in trouble. Mr.Graham is a man better not to mess with. He is a regular at many pubs but especially around Camden. </li>
            </ul>

    <h3>YOUR CHARACTER</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box">
            <ul>
                <h4>Oscar Watson - Vicar</h4>
                <li>Once a young soldier full of desire to fight for your country and protect the people you love, the war took a toll too big on you. Crimea wasn’t easy for anyone but you weren’t ready to see crippled friends, puddles of blood and piles of bodies. </li>
                <li>You made a deal with God: If he kept you safe, you would devote the rest of your life to serving him as a vicar. And so it happened, you survived with barely any scratches.  </li>
                <li>You went back to London and started your training to become a Vicar. For the past seven years since the war you have been a man of God and you are a guide to your parish. People from all parts of London come to you for moral guidance and support. You are a pillar in the local community.</li>
                <li>Lately times have gotten a bit strange. These modern times are bringing lots of troubles: gangs, labour exploitation, divorce, drugs… but also other problems you never thought you would see: demons and vampires.</li>
                <li>YA few people have come scared asking for purifications and protection against creatures from hell. It had happened before but only once every many months and by people that were not… very bright. Now there are starting to be signs that something is going on. Could the end of the days be near? </li>
                <li>You have always known about the Ackers, a family of greed and not much love for God or anything other than money but lately their actions have gotten much worst: raising rent prices to evict lower class citizens, exploiting their workers, rumours of mass killings in other continents… In one of your speeches you mentioned them as examples of a bad Catholic. They must have heard because Mr.Graham paid you a visit a few days ago. You were attending a woman who was asking about vampires when Mr.Graham walked in. Broke a couple of chairs, grabbed you by the neck and warned you that if you ever mentioned the name of Acker in any way that wasn’t good, he would kill you. Then he left.  </li>
                <li>When you saw the ad from Mr.Acker you thought it would be a good opportunity to learn about the situation and support your community. If vampires are real, only God is the answer.  </li>
                <li><strong>You are not the vampire. </strong></p>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h5>Important information for your character: </h5>
                <li>- You are a kind man </li>
                <li>- Your faith is really important to you</li>
                <li>- You want to donate the reward to help improve your community</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h5 class="things">Your relationship with other characters: </h5>
                <li><strong>Idris Dogan</strong>: You know him but you can’t remember exactly why. </li>
                <li><strong>Nathanial Cage</strong>: He was in the army in Crimea with you. But wait, didn't he die?</li>
                <li><strong>Mr.Graham</strong>: Stormed your church and threatened you because you spoke poorly about the Acker family once. </li>
                <li><strong>Edgar Wright</strong>: He has come to you asking advice about vampires. Apparently he makes weapons that kill them. But you believe that the only weapon that works is God. </li>
                <li><strong>Adelaide Brown</strong>: She came to you asking for information about vampires a couple of days ago. She carried a notebook and wrote down everything you said. She was the woman who saw Mr.Graham attacking you. She was concerned about your wellbeing. You are sure she is a good woman.</li>
            </ul>
