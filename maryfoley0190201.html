    <div id="rules">
        <h3 class="rules-title">IMPORTANT RULES:</h3>
        <ol id="ruleset">
            <li>1. Please don't share any details / comments with anyone until the Murder Mystery. Any small comment could reveal more than you think. </li>
            <li>2. Acting is key. Live your character, BE your character. </li>
            <li>3. If your character has to withhold information, hide it as you would hide your deepest secret. But if Mr.Acker (me) tells you “confess!” you have to reveal the information. </li>
            <li>4. If during the murder mystery you have any doubts or have revealed something that you shouldn’t have don’t worry. Come to me and we can sort it out. </li>
            <li>5. Feel free to add more personality to your character but please let me know first. Any alterations on the background could mess with the story. </li>
            <li>6. It is encouraged to dress up. You have total freedom to choose what your character looks like (but please try to keep it Victorian themed). </li>
            <li>7. Everything is for the show: If your character is questioned / someone is interrogating you and they are up to finding something out, help them out (within reason). Don’t look at it as winning or losing. There's no points system and there is no prize. Simply be part of the story, play along and enjoy. </li>
            <li>8. Have lots of fun :) </li>
        </ol>

    <h3>CONTEXT</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Date of the event</strong>: 26th of November, 1863.</li>
                <li><strong>Historical context</strong>: Queen Victoria was the UK's monarch and Henry John Temple was the PM. It had been 7 years since the end of the Crimean War (1856), where Russia lost to an alliance between the Ottoman Empire, the UK, France and Sardinia-Piedmont. Darwin had already published the Theory of Evolution and it started to become popular. Abraham Lincon is the president of the US and he had declared the first Thanksgiving on that year. The football association was created in England. Franz Ferdinard of Austria was born. The first section of the London underground was opened and many rails were built around the US and Europe. Divorce became allowed for citizens of all classes (not only upper class) although heavily stigmatised. </li>
                <li>The once all mighty and sovereign East India Company had fallen in 1858 after a year of the Sepoy Rebellion. This ended up with the company passing its powers to rule over the subcontinent to the United Kingdom’s monarchy, beginning the period known as the British Raj.</li>
                <li><strong>Story context</strong>: These are strange times... weird things happen, people talk and people die mysteriously. Rumours of supernatural phenomenons and beings are taking over Europe. One of the most popular ones and is vampirism. Mr. Acker, a very wealthy and powerful man from London has put up an ad looking for vampire experts. Apparently he has been threatened by a vampire and the local authorities haven't been able to help him.  He offers £350 to whoever finds and kills the vampire. In today's money, it would be the equivalent of £36.000. </li>
            </ul>

    <h3>GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box right">
            <ul>
                <h4>Mr.Acker</h4>
                <li>David Acker or Mr. Acker is the son of a rich and powerful man in London’s society. His father was one of the higher ups at the East India Company until the company was nationalised. Most of the family fortune comes from the shady deal that happened when the shareholders voted to accept a pay-off for their shares. The family also has many other businesses and shares in other companies as well as board seats.
                    His father (Sir Edward Acker) died three years ago of tuberculosis. Since then the son has taken on all the businesses of the family.</li>
                <li>But Mr. Acker’s ambitions weren’t satisfied with just continuing the legacy, he wanted to be even more powerful and feared than his dad was. He started an iron factory in Birmingham to supply guns to the empire. He also acquired lots of properties around London and started importing exotic products from different regions of the world to sell them to rich european collectionists.
                    He is well connected to the UK’s government and has even some ties with the monarchy but as any powerful person, he has created many enemies along the way.
                    This time it seems like it has gone even further than a simple enemy: He has been receiving threatening notes signed with blood and letting him know that a vampire was onto him. Since then, Mr. Acker has stopped appearing in public and given the inefficiency of the police on finding the person threatening him and his family he decided to hire a team of experts along with some contacts to hunt down the vampire. </li>

                <h4>Mr.Graham</h4>
                <li>Mr.Graham is Mr.Acker’s right hand. They have worked together for many years. He is the equivalent of a dog of prey: aggressive, intimidating and feared. </li> 
                <li>He goes where Mr.Acker sends him and is in charge of getting things done and protecting Mr.Acker’s interests and honour. He has brutally beaten up more people than anyone can count and everyone is pretty sure that he has even killed. Mr.Acker always covers his tracks so he never gets in trouble. Mr.Graham is a man better not to mess with. He is a regular at many pubs but especially around Camden. </li>

    <h3>YOUR CHARACTER</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box">
            <ul>
                <h4>Mary Foley - Writer</h4>
                <li>Born and raised in Edinburgh in a middle class family. Your life wasn’t remarkable at all, as a woman you had to hide lots of your talents to avoid public judgement. You got married 8 years ago to Charles Altamont Doyle, a famous illustrator that comes from a family of artists. He is also a civil servant. . </li>
                <li>Your true passion in life has always been writing. You have written several novels about crime and mystery but never had the courage to publish them. You tried to convince your husband to use his name but he refused since he was already an illustrator and didn’t want to raise any suspicions.  </li>
                <li>As a fan of mystery you are always walking around trying to find interesting things. You are very clever, logical and always trying to read inbetween lines. </li>
                <li>A few months ago, on one of your evening walks around the meadows you saw a woman kissing a man on his neck. “How inappropriate… “ you thought and didn’t mind it too much. Until the next day, when in the newspapers you read that a man had been killed in the meadows. Apparently something bit him on the neck. Something with very sharp fangs. </li>
                <li>You went to the police immediately to tell them what you saw, but they thought that a woman kissing a man was not a crime and that same man could have been killed later. “That’s not a bite a woman can make, even if she really tried to,” they said. In a very rude and dismissive way they invited you to just mind your business and “let men do men things and stop playing detectives”. </li>
                <li>That infuriated you, so you started investigating on your own. You thought that you could show those men that you were much better than them but also it could be great material for a book that would definitely be published!</li>
                <li>Unfortunately, you didn’t find much. No one had seen much. The only clue you managed to find was that apparently a very tall and strange man had been around for a couple of days asking questions and walking alone at night. He had an accent that was definitely not from the UK nor Western Europe. That didn’t help you much. </li>
                <li>A few weeks ago, you saw an ad in the newspaper: vampire experts wanted.  £350 reward! This was the best opportunity ever. You could learn a lot, get plenty of material to write an amazing book, maybe solve a crime and with that reward you could self publish your books! You talked to your husband and agreed that you would come to London to be one of the vampire experts. </li>
              
                <li><strong>You are not the vampire. </strong></p>
            </ul>
      
            <ul>
                <h5>Relationship with other characters: </h5>
                <li>- Idris Dogan seems to fit the description of the weird man in Edinburgh. Could it be him? Why would this man be in Edinburgh asking weird questions and walking alone at night? You need to find out. </li>

            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h5>Important information for your character: </h5>
                <li>- You need to mention a couple of times that your husband (you will call him by his full name: “Charles Doyle”. </li>
                <li>- You need to talk a lot about one of your kids: little Arthur. Mention that he is so creative and full of good stories. He is only 4. </li>
                <li>- If you spot any other "detectives" try to team up with them. </li>
                <li>- Talk to lots of people and try to know more about them so you can "create more interesting characters for your books". </li>
                <li>- Fun fact: Your character is the only one  based on a real person: Sir. Arthur Conan Doyle’s mother. I’ve added a lot to the character so there’s not much accuracy with the real one but still let’s see if someone gets it!</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h5 class="things">Things you can say:</h5>
                <li>- You are a writer</li>
                <li>- You are from Edinburgh</li>
                <li>- You are very sure that you saw a vampire attack (explain the story).</li>

                <h5>Things you can't say (unless properly questioned or found out):</h5>
                <li>- Nothing.</li>
