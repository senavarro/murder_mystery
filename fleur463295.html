        <ol id="ruleset">
            <li>1. Please don't share any details / comments with anyone until the Murder Mystery. Any small comment could reveal more than you think. </li>
            <li>2. Acting is key. Live your character, BE your character. </li>
            <li>3. If your character has to withhold information, hide it as you would hide your deepest secret. But if Mr.Acker (me) tells you “confess!” you have to reveal the information. </li>
            <li>4. If during the murder mystery you have any doubts or have revealed something that you shouldn’t have don’t worry. Come to me and we can sort it out. </li>
            <li>5. Feel free to add more personality to your character but please let me know first. Any alterations on the background could mess with the story. </li>
            <li>6. It is encouraged to dress up. You have total freedom to choose what your character looks like (but please try to keep it Victorian themed). </li>
            <li>7. Everything is for the show: If your character is questioned / someone is interrogating you and they are up to finding something out, help them out (within reason). Don’t look at it as winning or losing. There's no points system and there is no prize. Simply be part of the story, play along and enjoy. </li>
            <li>8. Have lots of fun :) </li>
        </ol>

    <h3>CONTEXT</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Date of the event</strong>: 26th of November, 1863.</li>
                <li><strong>Historical context</strong>: Queen Victoria was the UK's monarch and Henry John Temple was the PM. It had been 7 years since the end of the Crimean War (1856), where Russia lost to an alliance between the Ottoman Empire, the UK, France and Sardinia-Piedmont. Darwin had already published the Theory of Evolution and it started to become popular. Abraham Lincon is the president of the US and he had declared the first Thanksgiving on that year. The football association was created in England. Franz Ferdinard of Austria was born. The first section of the London underground was opened and many rails were built around the US and Europe. Divorce became allowed for citizens of all classes (not only upper class) although heavily stigmatised. </li>
                <li>The once all mighty and sovereign East India Company had fallen in 1858 after a year of the Sepoy Rebellion. This ended up with the company passing its powers to rule over the subcontinent to the United Kingdom’s monarchy, beginning the period known as the British Raj.</li>
                <li><strong>Story context</strong>: These are strange times... weird things happen, people talk and people die mysteriously. Rumours of supernatural phenomenons and beings are taking over Europe. One of the most popular ones and is vampirism. Mr. Acker, a very wealthy and powerful man from London has put up an ad looking for vampire experts. Apparently he has been threatened by a vampire and the local authorities haven't been able to help him.  He offers £350 to whoever finds and kills the vampire. In today's money, it would be the equivalent of £36.000. </li>
            </ul>

    <h3>GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box right">
            <ul>
                <h4>Mr.Acker</h4>
                <li>David Acker or Mr. Acker is the son of a rich and powerful man in London’s society. His father was one of the higher ups at the East India Company until the company was nationalised. Most of the family fortune comes from the shady deal that happened when the shareholders voted to accept a pay-off for their shares. The family also has many other businesses and shares in other companies as well as board seats.
                    His father (Sir Edward Acker) died three years ago of tuberculosis. Since then the son has taken on all the businesses of the family.</li>
                <li>But Mr. Acker’s ambitions weren’t satisfied with just continuing the legacy, he wanted to be even more powerful and feared than his dad was. He started an iron factory in Birmingham to supply guns to the empire. He also acquired lots of properties around London and started importing exotic products from different regions of the world to sell them to rich european collectionists.
                    He is well connected to the UK’s government and has even some ties with the monarchy but as any powerful person, he has created many enemies along the way.
                    This time it seems like it has gone even further than a simple enemy: He has been receiving threatening notes signed with blood and letting him know that a vampire was onto him. Since then, Mr. Acker has stopped appearing in public and given the inefficiency of the police on finding the person threatening him and his family he decided to hire a team of experts along with some contacts to hunt down the vampire. </li>

                <h4>Mr.Graham</h4>
                <li>Mr.Graham is Mr.Acker’s right hand. They have worked together for many years. He is the equivalent of a dog of prey: aggressive, intimidating and feared. </li> 
                <li>He goes where Mr.Acker sends him and is in charge of getting things done and protecting Mr.Acker’s interests and honour. He has brutally beaten up more people than anyone can count and everyone is pretty sure that he has even killed. Mr.Acker always covers his tracks so he never gets in trouble. Mr.Graham is a man better not to mess with. He is a regular at many pubs but especially around Camden. </li>

    <h3>YOUR CHARACTER</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box">
            <ul>
                <h4>Fleur Labelle - French Aristocrat / Collectionist </h4>
                <li>Born in Paris in 1833 you are not a royal but no one would ever guess that. Your family has been connected for generations to the French and / or Austrian monarchy and has benefited from many favours. What does your family do? Well you actually don’t know that well. You know you have lands in many places in France, and horses, and people working for you, and buildings all over Paris.  </li>
                <li>You have had everything you have always wanted which is… boring. You are so bored of everything being so easy and everyone trying to please you all the time…  </li>
                <li>Ten years ago, your mum fell ill and your dad took her away to another house so she was taking care of. He spent lots of time taking care of her and left you alone with the servants. To feel less lonely, you started reading about fantasy and horror fantasy and started being fascinated about the idea of supernatural things: “Finally something I can’t have” you thought to yourself. “I wonder how I can buy some…”. </li>
                <li>And that is how you started your interest in collecting bizarre objects and creatures. Swords that killed famous people, skulls of enemies of France, a cursed hand from Egypt, a rabbit with three eyes, a snake that ate a whole tribe in Brazil… But none of that was supernatural.  </li>
                <li>As it’s common for extremely rich people, you have had people working for you and expanding your collection but no one has been able to bring you anything paranormal so far. Just grotesque stuff, which you like but it’s not enough. You were aware that your rare interests had started some rumours among your servants and the people of Paris. They say that you worship Satan and that you do cult-like activities in your palace. Not that you actually minded about what commoners thought about you but they have quite an imagination. After your mum passed away five years ago, the rumours got even worse. You didn’t care that much about her because you had not seenher since your dad took her away. She was dead to you already anyways.</li>
                <li>When you were thinking that you would never get to own a supernatural thing in your collection your luck changed. Mr.Acker (a wealthy man, although not even close to your level of wealth) from the United Kingdom had put an advert to get people to hunt a vampire for him. How exciting!.</li>
                <li>You knew Mr.Acker from a couple of parties in the palace and in London but you had never directly met. He was a commoner in your eyes but still worth the visit if that could lead to a vampire. And maybe you could even kill two birds with one stone: You had also heard of a man named Gilbert Moore who was a specialist in acquiring really rare objects for collectors. He could be the man you have been looking for!</li>
                <li>With all of that in mind, you packed 70 cases and went for an adventure in London.</li>
                <li><strong>You are not the vampire. </strong></p>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h5>Important information for your character: </h5>
                <li>- You want to have a vampire in your collection. You need someone who kills it and then you can keep it. </li>
                <li>- You will insist a lot on talking to Gilbert Moore and hiring him. Don't take no for an answer.  </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h5 class="things">Your relationship with other characters: </h5>
                <li><strong>Mr.Acker</strong>:  You attended the same parties a few times but never directly met. </li>
                <li><strong>Eleanor Birtwistle</strong>: You know her. Her family is quite wealthy but again, not even close to yours. She is nice but rumours say she lost her mind since her husband died at the Crimean War. </li>
                <li><strong>Nathaniel Cage</strong>: He is quite a famous actor although he mainly acts in London. Any good actor that values themselves should come to Paris. </li>
                <li><strong>Edgar Wright</strong>: Your family hired him as an engineer to work on a project but you don’t know why. Your dad told you it was boring and not worth the explanation. </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h5 class="things">Things you can say:</h5>
                <li>- You want to have a dead vampire in your collection. </li>
                <li>- You are there also because you want to hire Gilbert Moore. He has access to collections of bat species and you want to expand yours. </li>
                <li>- Your mum fell ill when you were a kid and you never saw her again. Your dad spent lots of time taking care of her. She passed away five years ago.</li>
                <li>- You are not a satanist and do not do any weird rituals in your palace.  </li>


                <h5>Things you can't say (unless properly questioned or found out):</h5>
                <li>- Nothing. </li>
