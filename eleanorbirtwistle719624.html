            <li>2. Acting is key. Live your character, BE your character. </li>
            <li>3. If your character has to withhold information, hide it as you would hide your deepest secret. But if Mr.Acker (me) tells you “confess!” you have to reveal the information. </li>
            <li>4. If during the murder mystery you have any doubts or have revealed something that you shouldn’t have don’t worry. Come to me and we can sort it out. </li>

    <h3>CONTEXT</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Date of the event</strong>: 26th of November, 1863.</li>
                <li><strong>Historical context</strong>: Queen Victoria was the UK's monarch and Henry John Temple was the PM. It had been 7 years since the end of the Crimean War (1856), where Russia lost to an alliance between the Ottoman Empire, the UK, France and Sardinia-Piedmont. Darwin had already published the Theory of Evolution and it started to become popular. Abraham Lincon is the president of the US and he had declared the first Thanksgiving on that year. The football association was created in England. Franz Ferdinard of Austria was born. The first section of the London underground was opened and many rails were built around the US and Europe. Divorce became allowed for citizens of all classes (not only upper class) although heavily stigmatised. </li>
                <li>The once all mighty and sovereign East India Company had fallen in 1858 after a year of the Sepoy Rebellion. This ended up with the company passing its powers to rule over the subcontinent to the United Kingdom’s monarchy, beginning the period known as the British Raj.</li>
                <li><strong>Story context</strong>: These are strange times... weird things happen, people talk and people die mysteriously. Rumours of supernatural phenomenons and beings are taking over Europe. One of the most popular ones and is vampirism. Mr. Acker, a very wealthy and powerful man from London has put up an ad looking for vampire experts. Apparently he has been threatened by a vampire and the local authorities haven't been able to help him.  He offers £350 to whoever finds and kills the vampire. In today's money, it would be the equivalent of £36.000. </li>
            </ul>

    <h3>GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box right">
            <ul>
                <h4>Mr.Acker</h4>
                <li>David Acker or Mr. Acker is the son of a rich and powerful man in London’s society. His father was one of the higher ups at the East India Company until the company was nationalised. Most of the family fortune comes from the shady deal that happened when the shareholders voted to accept a pay-off for their shares. The family also has many other businesses and shares in other companies as well as board seats.
                    His father (Sir Edward Acker) died three years ago of tuberculosis. Since then the son has taken on all the businesses of the family.</li>
                <li>But Mr. Acker’s ambitions weren’t satisfied with just continuing the legacy, he wanted to be even more powerful and feared than his dad was. He started an iron factory in Birmingham to supply guns to the empire. He also acquired lots of properties around London and started importing exotic products from different regions of the world to sell them to rich european collectionists.
                    He is well connected to the UK’s government and has even some ties with the monarchy but as any powerful person, he has created many enemies along the way.
                    This time it seems like it has gone even further than a simple enemy: He has been receiving threatening notes signed with blood and letting him know that a vampire was onto him. Since then, Mr. Acker has stopped appearing in public and given the inefficiency of the police on finding the person threatening him and his family he decided to hire a team of experts along with some contacts to hunt down the vampire. </li>

                <h4>Mr.Graham</h4>
                <li>Mr.Graham is Mr.Acker’s right hand. They have worked together for many years. He is the equivalent of a dog of prey: aggressive, intimidating and feared. </li> 
                <li>He goes where Mr.Acker sends him and is in charge of getting things done and protecting Mr.Acker’s interests and honour. He has brutally beaten up more people than anyone can count and everyone is pretty sure that he has even killed. Mr.Acker always covers his tracks so he never gets in trouble. Mr.Graham is a man better not to mess with. He is a regular at many pubs but especially around Camden. </li>

    <h3>YOUR CHARACTER</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box">
            <ul>
                <h4>Eleanor Birtwistle - Aristocrat</h4>
                <li>Eleanor Birtwistle, a young aristocratic woman who knows well her higher place in society but also doesn’t mind being around commons.</li>
                <li>You are a very intelligent, sophisticated and well-educated woman who comes from a family of ship owners. Your family had close ties to the East India Company and you had met Mr. Ackle a few times but never got really close. You don’t dislike him but you know that he is the kind of man that it’s better to stay away from.</li>
                <li>You have lived your whole life in London and dream of a life of adventure like in the books that you like to read (especially Greek classics). You got married ten years ago when you were only 16 to a general of the army of the East India Company. When the company was dissolved, your husband went to fight in Crimea. Unfortunately, he died there. But… that is not the end of it. A few months after the war ended you came back home at night after visiting a friend and found your husband in your room. Just that he wasn’t really… himself. He looked pale, weak and something was different. Actually everything was different. </li>
                <li>He told you about how he was shot in the war, but managed to drag himself out to the woods and stayed there trying to recover. On the second night of being by himself in the woods he was approached by a woman. After seeing his poor state and that he wouldn’t make it, she bit his neck. He doesn’t remember anything after that except that he woke up several hours later and his wounds were healed and he felt completely recovered. But something was off… He walked back in the direction of the camp (around 70km away from where the battle took place). During that journey, he got really hungry and stopped at a family’s house. The family formed by a husband, a wife and two children offered him food but that didn’t make him less hungry. The longer he spent in that house the more he could hear their hearts beat and their blood flow through their necks. He stayed for the rest of the night. </li>
                <li>When the morning came, the man and the young children left to work in the field and he was left alone with the woman. Without being able to control himself, he brutally murdered her. When he regained control he had drunk a lot of blood and he was completely covered in it. Horrified by what he had done, he ran away. </li>
                <li>The daylight was somewhat painful, it gave him a headache and a feeling of irritation but the realisation of the atrocity he had committed and thinking about that poor family kept him going. He couldn’t go back to the army, he should stay away from everyone. The only place he could go was home, so he walked home trying to avoid people and sunlight. He had not killed anyone else and tried to feed himself off animal’s blood, but that didn’t really do it, hence his weak appearance. </li>
                <li>You were really scared but your love for your husband was so strong that you came up with a plan: He would feed off you, a tiny bit of blood every night, enough to keep him alive and in a decent state. He would not leave the house and no one could know that he was alive and you would always wear a scarf to hide your marks. </li>
                <li>That worked months, until one night after you returned home from a mass and he was gone. You haven’t seen him since then. It’s been seven years but you never gave up hope on finding him. When you heard that Mr. Acker was being threatened by a vampire, you decided to investigate more to see if it could be your husband. </li>
                <li><strong>You are not the vampire. </strong></li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h5>Important information for your character: </h5>
                <li>- You need to wear something that covers your neck. If you can, try to apply something on your neck that can ressemble fang marks. If that is not possible, please let me know. </li>
                <li>- Your husband's name was (or is) Oliver Hall. He was a man in his late 30s, 6’ tall, rather skinny and with dark short hair. He had a scar on his left cheek from a war in India. His eyes were dark and his skin rather pale. He used to always wear your wedding ring (a gold ring with a big diamond). </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h5 class="things">Your relationship with other characters: </h5>
                <li><strong>Mr.Acker</strong>: You know Mr. Acker and he knows you but you are not that close. He knew your husband as he worked for him. He knows your husband died at the war and this is the first time you see each other since the funeral (where he attended but never spoke to you). You have also heard that he has been killing tribes around Central and South America in order to collect exotic items and occupy their lands and you disapprove of it.</li>
                <li><strong>Fleur Labelle</strong>: Aristocracy knows aristocracy, and you have been to a few parties organised by the eccentric and wealthy parisian Fleur Labelle. She collects exotic items and rumours say that she organises very weird group gatherings with intimate friends on full moon nights. What happens in those meetings is completely unknown. But of course that could just be a rumour…</li>
                <li><strong>Jack Cooper and Eliza Evans</strong>: You have heard of this low lifes quite recently. They are the heads of a gang that runs some businesses in Birmingham but everyone knows that their money and power comes from organised crime and trafficking guns that they steal from the factory. They have been in the newspapers a few times but they only got your attention last week when rumours claim that they killed a vampire that was messing with their business. Apparently they beat him to… death? You want to know if it was your husband. You will ask them a lot of questions. </li>
                <li><strong>Nathaniel Cage</strong>: You know he is a famous actor. You saw him in a Shakespeare play. </li>
                <li><strong>Lily Clarke</strong>: In your relentless search for your husband, a month ago you found out that a very famous occultist from New Orleans had moved to London. You went to visit her. Her name is Lily Clarke and she has a shop in Camden. In a moment of weakness, you entered the shop. Troubled as you were, she asked you what was wrong. When you started to tell her about your case you thought that if people knew that your husband was a vampire they would kill him. And probably you as well. You thought better and left in a rush. You think you might have mentioned your husband in that conversation but you are completely sure that you didn’t mention anything about vampires. </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h5 class="things">Things you can say:</h5>
                <li>- Your husband died in the Crimean War.</li>
                <li>- If asked, you went to Lily Clark’s shop because you thought that she could put you in contact with your dead husband through some occultism, but then thought about it better. (if someone questions why you visited Lily Clark asking about a husband that died eight years ago). </li>
                <li>- You thought Lily Clark was from New Orleans. </li>
                <li>- All you know about vampires but if someone asks why you know so much you can say that it's because you love reading.</li>


                <h5>Things you can't say (unless properly questioned or found out):</h5>
                <li>- Your husband was (or is) a vampire (if it is discovered, you need to tell the whole story except the fact that you fed him. If they ask you how he stayed alive or to remove your scarf, you have to tell the truth).</li>
                <li>- You are looking for your vampire husband.</li>
                <li>- You fed your husband with your own blood (unless they figure out that you wear a scarf to hide the marks. If they ask you to remove it and they are onto you, you can tell your story). Then you can proceed to claim your innocence.  </li>
