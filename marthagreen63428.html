        <h3>IMPORTANT RULES:</h3>
        <ol id="ruleset">
            <li>1. Please don't share any details / comments with anyone until the Murder Mystery. Any small comment could reveal more than you think. </li>
            <li>2. Acting is key. Live your character, BE your character. </li>
            <li>3. If your character has to withhold information, hide it as you would hide your deepest secret. But if Mr.Acker (me) tells you “confess!” you have to reveal the information. </li>
            <li>4. If during the murder mystery you have any doubts or have revealed something that you shouldn’t have don’t worry. Come to me and we can sort it out. </li>
            <li>5. Feel free to add more personality to your character but please let me know first. Any alterations on the background could mess with the story. </li>
            <li>6. It is encouraged to dress up. You have total freedom to choose what your character looks like (but please try to keep it Victorian themed). </li>
            <li>7. Everything is for the show: If your character is questioned / someone is interrogating you and they are up to finding something out, help them out (within reason). Don’t look at it as winning or losing. There's no points system and there is no prize. Simply be part of the story, play along and enjoy. </li>
            <li>8. Have lots of fun :) </li>
        </ol>

    <h3>CONTEXT</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Date of the event</strong>: 26th of November, 1863.</li>
                <li><strong>Historical context</strong>: Queen Victoria is the monarch in the UK and Henry John Temple was PM. It had been 7 years (1856) since the end of the Crimean War, where Russia lost to an alliance between the Ottoman Empire, the UK, France and Sardinia-Piedmont. Darwin had already published the Theory of Evolution and it started to become popular. Abraham Lincon is president of the US and he declares the first Thanksgiving. The football association was created in England. Franz Ferdinard of Austria was born. The first section of the London underground was opened and many rails were built around the US and Europe. Divorce became allowed for citizens of all classes (not only upper class) although heavily stigmatised. </li>
                <li>The once all mighty and sovereign East India Company had fallen in 1858 after a year of the Sepoy Rebellion. This ended up with the company passing its powers to rule over the subcontinent to the United Kingdom’s monarchy, beginning the period known as the British Raj.</li>
                <li><strong>Story context</strong>: In these days fears of supernatural powers and pests are gaining popularity amongst the people, one of the most populars and is vampirism. Mr. Acker, a very wealthy and powerful man from London, put up an ad looking for vampire hunters. Apparently he has been threatened by a vampire and the local authority hasn’t been able to help him.  He offers £350 to whoever finds and kills the vampire. In today's money, it would be the equivalent of £36.000. </li>
            </ul>

    <h3>GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box right">
            <ul>
                <h4>Mr.Acker</h4>
                <li>David Acker or Mr. Acker is the son of a rich and powerful man in London’s society. His father was one of the higher ups at the East India Company until the company was nationalised. Most of the family fortune comes from the shady deal that happened when the shareholders voted to accept a pay-off for their shares. The family also has many other businesses and shares in other companies as well as board seats.
                    His father (Sir Edward Acker) died three years ago of tuberculosis. Since then the son has taken on all the businesses of the family.</li>
                <li>But Mr. Acker’s ambitions weren’t satisfied with just continuing the legacy, he wanted to be even more powerful and feared than his dad was. He started an iron factory in Birmingham to supply guns to the empire. He also acquired lots of properties around London and started importing exotic products from different regions of the world to sell them to rich european collectionists.
                    He is well connected to the UK’s government and has even some ties with the monarchy but as any powerful person, he has created many enemies along the way.
                    This time it seems like it has gone even further than a simple enemy: He has been receiving threatening notes signed with blood and letting him know that a vampire was onto him. Since then, Mr. Acker has stopped appearing in public and given the inefficiency of the police on finding the person threatening him and his family he decided to hire a team of experts along with some contacts to hunt down the vampire. </li>

                <h4>Mr.Graham</h4>
                <li>Mr.Graham is Mr.Acker’s right hand. They have worked together for many years. He is the equivalent of a dog of prey: aggressive, intimidating and feared. </li> 
                <li>He goes where Mr.Acker sends him and is in charge of getting things done and protecting Mr.Acker’s interests and honour. He has brutally beaten up more people than anyone can count and everyone is pretty sure that he has even killed. Mr.Acker always covers his tracks so he never gets in trouble. Mr.Graham is a man better not to mess with. He is a regular at many pubs but especially around Camden. </li>
            </ul>

    <h3>YOUR CHARACTER</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box">
            <ul>
                <h4>Martha Green - Mr.Acker's family doctor</h4>
                <li>Born and raised in London. You have been the family’s doctor for eight years now, after the last one retired. Since he started receiving threats he keeps you close to him in case of an emergency. </li>
                <li>You studied medicine in Cambridge and worked at Greenwhich’s hospital until Mr. Acker reached out to you to hire you as his family’s doctor (as said, eight years ago). It happened right after you accidentally killed one of your patients after giving an experimental treatment that you read about in a note left on your desk. It was a natural remedy that worked really well at the beginning but one day, you still don’t know how, gave him the wrong dose. The overdose killed him.</li>
                <li>You were also taking care of Mr. Graham because Mr.Acker asked you to. The previous day he went to the clinic and claimed to be feeling a bit better. But on the day of the reunion he doesn’t attend. You will send someone to check on him in his house. The nurse will send a telegram later saying that they found him dead with fang marks on his neck. The window was open. They think he died several hours ago, probably during the night.</li>

                <li><strong>You are not the vampire. </strong></p>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h5>Important information for your character: </h5>
                <li>- Some people tend to confuse vampirism with other diseases (such as rabies). Some symptoms of rabies that are similar are: extreme aggression, blood injected eyes, biting people. Some symptoms that are not part of vampirism are: foam in their mouths, muscle spasms, difficulty to breathe, and dying after a few days. Any time you are asked a question and have a doubt you have to say “Let me speak to Mr. Acker and see if he is happy with me discussing this information”. The origins of vampirism are unclear, and you still doubt it’s an actual disease. Theoretically it comes from an ancient curse, but you think that if it were to exist it would probably come from an animal transmission, probably bats. Still there’s nothing to back up its existence. </li>
                <li>- You don't have any relationship with other characters (that you know of). Other characters may or may not know each other.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h5 class="things">Things you can say:</h5>
                <li>- You studied at Cambridge. </li>
                <li>- You worked at Greenwich Hospital for 5 years until 8 years ago (only if asked). </li>
                <li>- You have been Mr.Acker’s doctor for 8 years. </li>
                <li>- If someone asks about vampires and / or vampirism, you can share your knowledge. </li>


                <h5>Things you can't say (unless properly questioned or found out):</h5>
                <li>- Unless someone asks, you can’t talk about the patient you accidentally killed. If they ask, you can tell them the whole story. You don’t remember what was the natural remedy but they were weird plants. You also don’t know how the note got there.</li>
