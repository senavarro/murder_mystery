    <h2>Welcome, Nathaniel Cage</h2>

    <div id="rules">
        <h3 class="rules-title">IMPORTANT RULES:</h3>
        <ol id="ruleset">
            <li>1. Acting is key. Live your character, BE your character. </li>
            <li>2. If your character has to withhold information, hide it as you would hide your deepest secret. But if Mr.Acker (me) tells you “confess!” you have to reveal the information. </li>
            <li>3. If during the murder mystery you have any doubts or have revealed something that you shouldn’t have don’t worry. Come to me and we can sort it out. </li>
            <li>4. Feel free to add more personality to your character but please let me know first. Any alterations on the background could mess with the story. </li>
            <li>5. It is encouraged to dress up. You have total freedom to choose what your character looks like (but please try to keep it Victorian themed). </li>
            <li>6. Everything is for the show: If your character is questioned / someone is interrogating you and they are up to finding something out help them out (within reason). Don’t look at it as winning or losing. It’s not a points system and there is no price. Simply be part of the story, play along and enjoy. </li>
            <li>7. Have lots of fun :) </li>
        </ol>

    <h3>CONTEXT</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Date of the event</strong>: 26th of November, 1863.</li>
                <li><strong>Historical context</strong>: Queen Victoria is the monarch in the UK and Henry John Temple was PM. It had been 7 years (1856) since the end of the Crimean War, where Russia lost to an alliance between the Ottoman Empire, the UK, France and Sardinia-Piedmont. Darwin had already published the Theory of Evolution and it started to become popular. Abraham Lincon is president of the US and he declares the first Thanksgiving. The football association was created in England. Franz Ferdinard of Austria was born. The first section of the London underground was opened and many rails were built around the US and Europe. Divorce became allowed for citizens of all classes (not only upper class) although heavily stigmatised. </li>
                <li>The once all mighty and sovereign East India Company had fallen in 1858 after a year of the Sepoy Rebellion. This ended up with the company passing its powers to rule over the subcontinent to the United Kingdom’s monarchy, beginning the period known as the British Raj.</li>
                <li><strong>Story context</strong>: In these days fears of supernatural powers and pests are gaining popularity amongst the people, one of the most populars and is vampirism. Mr. Acker, a very wealthy and powerful man from London, put up an ad looking for vampire hunters. Apparently he has been threatened by a vampire and the local authority hasn’t been able to help him.  He offers £350 to whoever finds and kills the vampire. In today's money, it would be the equivalent of £36.000. </li>
            </ul>

    <h3>GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box right">
            <ul>
                <h4>Mr.Acker</h4>
                <li>David Acker or Mr. Acker is the son of a rich and powerful man in London’s society. His father was one of the higher ups at the East India Company until the company was nationalised. Most of the family fortune comes from the shady deal that happened when the shareholders voted to accept a pay-off for their shares. The family also has many other businesses and shares in other companies as well as board seats.
                    His father (Sir Edward Acker) died three years ago of tuberculosis. Since then the son has taken on all the businesses of the family.</li>
                <li>But Mr. Acker’s ambitions weren’t satisfied with just continuing the legacy, he wanted to be even more powerful and feared than his dad was. He started an iron factory in Birmingham to supply guns to the empire. He also acquired lots of properties around London and started importing exotic products from different regions of the world to sell them to rich european collectionists.
                    He is well connected to the UK’s government and has even some ties with the monarchy but as any powerful person, he has created many enemies along the way.
                    This time it seems like it has gone even further than a simple enemy: He has been receiving threatening notes signed with blood and letting him know that a vampire was onto him. Since then, Mr. Acker has stopped appearing in public and given the inefficiency of the police on finding the person threatening him and his family he decided to hire a team of experts along with some contacts to hunt down the vampire. </li>

                <h4>Mr.Graham</h4>
                <li>Mr.Graham is Mr.Acker’s right hand. They have worked together for many years. He is the equivalent of a dog of prey: aggressive, intimidating and feared. </li> 
                <li>He goes where Mr.Acker sends him and is in charge of getting things done and protecting Mr.Acker’s interests and honour. He has brutally beaten up more people than anyone can count and everyone is pretty sure that he has even killed. Mr.Acker always covers his tracks so he never gets in trouble. Mr.Graham is a man better not to mess with. He is a regular at many pubs but especially around Camden. </li>
            </ul>

    <h3>YOUR CHARACTER</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box">
            <ul>
                <h4>Nathaniel Cage - War Veteran / Actor</h4>
                <li>You were born in Brighton in 1831.</li>
                <li>You signed up to fight in the Crimean War because you love your country.</li>
                <li>Towards the end of the war, your weapon got jammed during a battle and that caused you to get shot. Your mates left you behind thinking you were dead, and truth is, you were very close to it. You were in and out of consciousness for a week until an old man found you on the battlefield. He was looking for soldier uniforms he could use in his performances: it turned out he was an actor from a nearby town.</li>
                <li>The man took you to his home and helped you heal. To repay him for saving his life and because you couldn’t stomach seeing your partners who left you behind to die, you stayed with him for six years years, until he passed away. He taught you about acting so when he died, you came back to London and decided to be an actor. </li>
                <li>Once you came back to London, you started acting in small plays. You had a natural talent and charisma that started attracting more and more people to the plays you were part of. Eventually your roles grew and now you play important roles in the more relevant plays of London. Recently you played Hamlet in the namesake play. </li>
                <li>Don’t be surprised if some people recognise you. </li>
                <li>As a famous actor you have a very active lifestyle. You usually drink and party around the pubs in Camden. </li>
                <li><strong>You are not the vampire. </strong></p>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h5>Important information for your character: </h5>
                <li>- In Crimea you heard rumours about soldiers dying mysteriously in the night. Some soldiers claimed that vampires were attacking the camps and looking around battlefields looking for wounded soldiers, but you never saw anything. </li>
                <li>- The old actor also used to believe in vampires but he would not talk much about it. </li>
                <li>- You love using the word "Stravaganza"</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h5 class="things">Your relationship with other characters: </h5>
                <li><strong>Edgar Wright</strong>: When you hear the name, you will recognise it: That name is in the rifle that jammed and almost got you killed. He is the man designing them. You will blame him for what happened to you. </li>
                <li><strong>Mr.Acker</strong>: You know he is a very powerful and rich man. He has the reputation of being harsh and ruthless. You met him once after he came to one of your plays and spoke briefly because someone introduced you. He is not a big fan of small talk and doesn't care about your fame. </li>
                <li><strong>Mr.Graham</strong>: He is also a regular at pubs in Camden. Everyone seems to fear him. He has the reputation of being a very violent man and he is very close to Mr.Acker. </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h5 class="things">Things you can say:</h5>
                <li>- You fought in the Crimean War. </li>
                <li>- Your rifle jammed.</li>
                <li>- You frequent the pubs in Camden. </li>


                <h5>Things you can't say (unless properly questioned or found out):</h5>
                <li>- You were left to die in Crimea (until someone mentions it). It is a trauma for you and just prefer not talking about it. You can also explain the whole story (the old man found you etc.)</li>
