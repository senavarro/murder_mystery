        <ol id="ruleset">
            <li>1. Please don't share any details / comments with anyone until the Murder Mystery. Any small comment could reveal more than you think. </li>
            <li>2. Acting is key. Live your character, BE your character. </li>
            <li>3. If your character has to withhold information, hide it as you would hide your deepest secret. But if Mr.Acker (me) tells you “confess!” you have to reveal the information. </li>
            <li>4. If during the murder mystery you have any doubts or have revealed something that you shouldn’t have don’t worry. Come to me and we can sort it out. </li>
            <li>5. Feel free to add more personality to your character but please let me know first. Any alterations on the background could mess with the story. </li>
            <li>6. It is encouraged to dress up. You have total freedom to choose what your character looks like (but please try to keep it Victorian themed). </li>
            <li>7. Everything is for the show: If your character is questioned / someone is interrogating you and they are up to finding something out, help them out (within reason). Don’t look at it as winning or losing. There's no points system and there is no prize. Simply be part of the story, play along and enjoy. </li>
            <li>8. Have lots of fun :) </li>
        </ol>

    <h3>CONTEXT</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Date of the event</strong>: 26th of November, 1863.</li>
                <li><strong>Historical context</strong>: Queen Victoria was the UK's monarch and Henry John Temple was the PM. It had been 7 years since the end of the Crimean War (1856), where Russia lost to an alliance between the Ottoman Empire, the UK, France and Sardinia-Piedmont. Darwin had already published the Theory of Evolution and it started to become popular. Abraham Lincon is the president of the US and he had declared the first Thanksgiving on that year. The football association was created in England. Franz Ferdinard of Austria was born. The first section of the London underground was opened and many rails were built around the US and Europe. Divorce became allowed for citizens of all classes (not only upper class) although heavily stigmatised. </li>
                <li>The once all mighty and sovereign East India Company had fallen in 1858 after a year of the Sepoy Rebellion. This ended up with the company passing its powers to rule over the subcontinent to the United Kingdom’s monarchy, beginning the period known as the British Raj.</li>
                <li><strong>Story context</strong>: These are strange times... weird things happen, people talk and people die mysteriously. Rumours of supernatural phenomenons and beings are taking over Europe. One of the most popular ones and is vampirism. Mr. Acker, a very wealthy and powerful man from London has put up an ad looking for vampire experts. Apparently he has been threatened by a vampire and the local authorities haven't been able to help him.  He offers £350 to whoever finds and kills the vampire. In today's money, it would be the equivalent of £36.000. </li>
            </ul>

    <h3>GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box right">
            <ul>
                <h4>Mr.Acker</h4>
                <li>David Acker or Mr. Acker is the son of a rich and powerful man in London’s society. His father was one of the higher ups at the East India Company until the company was nationalised. Most of the family fortune comes from the shady deal that happened when the shareholders voted to accept a pay-off for their shares. The family also has many other businesses and shares in other companies as well as board seats.
                    His father (Sir Edward Acker) died three years ago of tuberculosis. Since then the son has taken on all the businesses of the family.</li>
                <li>But Mr. Acker’s ambitions weren’t satisfied with just continuing the legacy, he wanted to be even more powerful and feared than his dad was. He started an iron factory in Birmingham to supply guns to the empire. He also acquired lots of properties around London and started importing exotic products from different regions of the world to sell them to rich european collectionists.
                    He is well connected to the UK’s government and has even some ties with the monarchy but as any powerful person, he has created many enemies along the way.
                    This time it seems like it has gone even further than a simple enemy: He has been receiving threatening notes signed with blood and letting him know that a vampire was onto him. Since then, Mr. Acker has stopped appearing in public and given the inefficiency of the police on finding the person threatening him and his family he decided to hire a team of experts along with some contacts to hunt down the vampire. </li>

                <h4>Mr.Graham</h4>
                <li>Mr.Graham is Mr.Acker’s right hand. They have worked together for many years. He is the equivalent of a dog of prey: aggressive, intimidating and feared. </li> 
                <li>He goes where Mr.Acker sends him and is in charge of getting things done and protecting Mr.Acker’s interests and honour. He has brutally beaten up more people than anyone can count and everyone is pretty sure that he has even killed. Mr.Acker always covers his tracks so he never gets in trouble. Mr.Graham is a man better not to mess with. He is a regular at many pubs but especially around Camden. </li>
            </ul>

    <h3>YOUR CHARACTER</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box">
            <ul>
                <h4>Alfred Williams - Policeman</h4>
                <li>Born and raised in London in a middle class family. You joined the police at the age of 18 because you believe in fairness and justice. In your everyday job you try to apply your principles even though sometimes it can be really hard.  </li>
                <li>Another thing that is not great about the job is the salary. You want to be able to afford the good things in life and provide for a family one day but at the same time you don’t want to stop being of service to the community. Lately very strange crimes have been happening. Brutal murders, victims with strange marks, even children… Rumours are blaming it on vampires but you never actually thought they were real. “Maybe some folks may think that if they have not had much access to education, fair enough, but surely there must be another reason… right?” </li>
                <li>When you saw Mr.Acker’s ad looking for vampire experts you were really surprised: “A man of his class and he believes in vampires as well? Is the world going crazy or maybe they are actually onto something…”. As a policeman you couldn’t let the case slip away. Worst case scenario there is a murderer on the streets and you can find out more stuf about this person and get closer to catching them. In the best case you arrest whoever is responsible for this, whether it’s a human or a vampire or whatever, and save lots of lives. On top of that you get an amazing reward that would change yours and your family’s life. What’s there to lose?. </li>
               
                <li><strong>You are not the vampire. </strong></p>
            </ul>
      
            <ul>
                <h5>Relationship with other characters: </h5>
               <li><strong>Oscar Watson</strong>: He is a vicar and has a good reputation. His community really appreciates him. He doesn’t know you but you have definitely heard his name. Although apparently someone tried to attack him at his church not long ago. The world is definitely going crazy. </li>
               <li><strong>Nathaniel Cage</strong>: He is a famous actor that plays shakespeare. You have seen him a couple of times. He is also causing havoc around Camden some nights. He is a heavy drinker.  </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h5>Important information for your character: </h5>
                <li>- Your character will try to keep Mr.Acker from committing any crazy acts. </li>
                <li>- You are a policeman but you don’t believe that the rules are always 100% right. You can bend them sometimes or look the other way if you believe that it’s for the greater good. </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h5 class="things">Things you can say:</h5>
                <li>- Almost everything (see below)</li>

                <h5>Things you can't say (unless properly questioned or found out):</h5>
                <li>- Try to not reveal straight away that you are a policeman. Some people might feel uncomfortable with you around... Vampire experts don't always live on the good side of the law. </li>

            </ul>
