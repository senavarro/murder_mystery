        <h3>IMPORTANT RULES:</h3>
        <ol id="ruleset">
            <li>1. Please don't share any details / comments with anyone until the Murder Mystery. Any small comment could reveal more than you think. </li>
            <li>2. Acting is key. Live your character, BE your character. </li>
            <li>2. If your character has to withhold information, hide it as you would hide your deepest secret. But if Mr.Acker (me) tells you “confess!” you have to reveal the information. </li>
            <li>3. If during the murder mystery you have any doubts or have revealed something that you shouldn’t have don’t worry. Come to me and we can sort it out. </li>
            <li>4. Feel free to add more personality to your character but please let me know first. Any alterations on the background could mess with the story. </li>
            <li>5. It is encouraged to dress up. You have total freedom to choose what your character looks like (but please try to keep it Victorian themed). </li>
            <li>6. Everything is for the show: If your character is questioned / someone is interrogating you and they are up to finding something out help them out (within reason). Don’t look at it as winning or losing. It’s not a points system and there is no price. Simply be part of the story, play along and enjoy. </li>
            <li>7. Have lots of fun :) </li>

    <h3>CONTEXT</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Date of the event</strong>: 26th of November, 1863.</li>
                <li><strong>Historical context</strong>: Queen Victoria is the monarch in the UK and Henry John Temple was PM. It had been 7 years (1856) since the end of the Crimean War, where Russia lost to an alliance between the Ottoman Empire, the UK, France and Sardinia-Piedmont. Darwin had already published the Theory of Evolution and it started to become popular. Abraham Lincon is president of the US and he declares the first Thanksgiving. The football association was created in England. Franz Ferdinard of Austria was born. The first section of the London underground was opened and many rails were built around the US and Europe. Divorce became allowed for citizens of all classes (not only upper class) although heavily stigmatised. </li>
                <li>The once all mighty and sovereign East India Company had fallen in 1858 after a year of the Sepoy Rebellion. This ended up with the company passing its powers to rule over the subcontinent to the United Kingdom’s monarchy, beginning the period known as the British Raj.</li>
                <li><strong>Story context</strong>: In these days fears of supernatural powers and pests are gaining popularity amongst the people, one of the most populars and feared is vampirism. Mr. Acker, a very wealthy and powerful man from London, put up an ad looking for vampire hunters. Apparently he has been threatened by a vampire and the local authority hasn’t been able to help him.  He offers £350 to whoever finds and kills the vampire. In today's money, it would be the equivalent of £36.000. </li>
            </ul>

    <h3>GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box right">
            <ul>
                <h4>Mr.Acker</h4>
                <li>David Acker or Mr. Acker is the son of a rich and powerful man in London’s society. His father was one of the higher ups at the East India Company until the company was nationalised. Most of the family fortune comes from the shady deal that happened when the shareholders voted to accept a pay-off for their shares. The family also has many other businesses and shares in other companies as well as board seats.
                    His father (Sir Edward Acker) died three years ago of tuberculosis. Since then the son has taken on all the businesses of the family.</li>
                <li>But Mr. Acker’s ambitions weren’t satisfied with just continuing the legacy, he wanted to be even more powerful and feared than his dad was. He started an iron factory in Birmingham to supply guns to the empire. He also acquired lots of properties around London and started importing exotic products from different regions of the world to sell them to rich european collectionists.
                    He is well connected to the UK’s government and has even some ties with the monarchy but as any powerful person, he has created many enemies along the way.
                    This time it seems like it has gone even further than a simple enemy: He has been receiving threatening notes signed with blood and letting him know that a vampire was onto him. Since then, Mr. Acker has stopped appearing in public and given the inefficiency of the police on finding the person threatening him and his family he decided to hire a team of experts along with some contacts to hunt down the vampire. </li>

                <h4>Mr.Graham</h4>
                <li>Mr.Graham is Mr.Acker’s right hand. They have worked together for many years. He is the equivalent of a dog of prey: aggressive, intimidating and feared. </li> 
                <li>He goes where Mr.Acker sends him and is in charge of getting things done and protecting Mr.Acker’s interests and honour. He has brutally beaten up more people than anyone can count and everyone is pretty sure that he has even killed. Mr.Acker always covers his tracks so he never gets in trouble. Mr.Graham is a man better not to mess with. He is a regular at many pubs but especially around Camden. </li>
            </ul>

    <h3>YOUR CHARACTER</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box">
            <ul>
                <h4>Elisabeth (Lily) Clarke - Occultist</h4>
                <li>You are an expert in the dark arts. You grew up in London up until the age of 15, when your dad lost his job as a soldier at the East India Company due to the company being nationalised. Sir Acker promised sharing the profits and taking care of the employees but that was just a lie to avoid riots during the operation. Your family had to sell everything you had and still it wasn’t enough. A lack of money and job opportunities pushed your family to live in extreme poverty for a year until your parents decided to go to New Orleans to start a new life. </li>
                <li>There you learned everything about crioll magic and the dark arts and then decided it was time to come back to London. You were too late to carry out your vengeance against Sir Acker but Mr. Acker is as bad and that will do it for you. It’s time to end this lineage and you will deal with whoever stands in your way. </li>
                <li>You have been back in London for three months now and you run your business from a small shop in Camden. There you give advice to people, free them from evil spirits and give them protection. </li>
                <li>Two weeks ago, Mr.Graham (Mr.Acker’s second in command) came to your shop for advice. He claimed to be the victim of a vampire curse. Knowing who he was, you gave him fake advice and a couple of placebo potions. You wanted him to die. </li>
                <li>He came back last week and threatened you. He shouted at you saying that your remedies don’t work, that you scammed him and that you will pay for it with. He wanted to shut down your shop and then put you in jail. You knew he had the power to do it so you needed to come up with a plan. </li>
                <li>You would follow Mr.Graham at night (he used to be a regular at several pubs in Camden) and once the opportunity was clear, you would kill him. </li>
                <li>You followed him several nights patiently, but he was always around people. Finally an opportunity appeared last night when he went to a pub and came out after 20 minutes looking pretty drunk and struggling to walk home. On the way to his house, you noticed that a man was following him so you couldn’t do anything but watch. After Mr.Graham got to his house, you saw a cloaked figure climb up to his window and enter the property, but it was a different person since the man that was following him was hiding around a corner, keeping an eye on the property as well. The individual left after a short amount of time then you saw the second man hesitate whether to follow the figure with the cloak. He then decided to climb up to the property as well. Shortly after he climbed down and left running. </li>
                <li>You decided it was time to go home. Mr.Graham was probably dead and you didn’t want to deal with the consequences of a crime you were not lucky enough to commit. But for sure Mr.Acker’s meeting would be very interesting the next day. Would he know about Mr.Graham already? And without his second in command, killing him will be much easier. </li>
                <li><strong>You are not the vampire. </strong></p>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>Oscar Watson</strong>: You have heard of this man. He is a vicar. You hate them but it's nothing personal, it's just that you hate anyone that has anything to do with the church. </li>
                <li><strong>Idris Dogan</strong>: You recognise him as the man who was following Mr.Graham last night. But why would you know that he was following him unless you were following him? Only reveal this information if you are accused and they figure out you were following Mr.Graham. </li>
                <li><strong>Eleanor Birwistle</strong>: You recognise her as a young woman who came to your shop a month ago asking for help. When you asked her what was wrong, she bursted into tears, and tried to mumble a few words but then left in a rush. You only understood: “my husband”. </li>
                <li><strong>Edgar Wright</strong>: He makes weird weapons to kill monsters. You have been to his shop a few times. As an occultist you always need to stay informed of the latest trends, and overall well protected. </li>
