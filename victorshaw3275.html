        <ol id="ruleset">
            <li>1. Please don't share any details / comments with anyone until the Murder Mystery. Any small comment could reveal more than you think. </li>
            <li>2. Acting is key. Live your character, BE your character. </li>
            <li>3. If your character has to withhold information, hide it as you would hide your deepest secret. But if Mr.Acker (me) tells you “confess!” you have to reveal the information. </li>
            <li>4. If during the murder mystery you have any doubts or have revealed something that you shouldn’t have don’t worry. Come to me and we can sort it out. </li>
            <li>5. Feel free to add more personality to your character but please let me know first. Any alterations on the background could mess with the story. </li>
            <li>6. It is encouraged to dress up. You have total freedom to choose what your character looks like (but please try to keep it Victorian themed). </li>
            <li>7. Everything is for the show: If your character is questioned / someone is interrogating you and they are up to finding something out, help them out (within reason). Don’t look at it as winning or losing. There's no points system and there is no prize. Simply be part of the story, play along and enjoy. </li>
            <li>8. Have lots of fun :) </li>
        </ol>

    <h3>CONTEXT</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Date of the event</strong>: 26th of November, 1863.</li>
                <li><strong>Historical context</strong>: Queen Victoria was the UK's monarch and Henry John Temple was the PM. It had been 7 years since the end of the Crimean War (1856), where Russia lost to an alliance between the Ottoman Empire, the UK, France and Sardinia-Piedmont. Darwin had already published the Theory of Evolution and it started to become popular. Abraham Lincon is the president of the US and he had declared the first Thanksgiving on that year. The football association was created in England. Franz Ferdinard of Austria was born. The first section of the London underground was opened and many rails were built around the US and Europe. Divorce became allowed for citizens of all classes (not only upper class) although heavily stigmatised. </li>
                <li>The once all mighty and sovereign East India Company had fallen in 1858 after a year of the Sepoy Rebellion. This ended up with the company passing its powers to rule over the subcontinent to the United Kingdom’s monarchy, beginning the period known as the British Raj.</li>
                <li><strong>Story context</strong>: These are strange times... weird things happen, people talk and people die mysteriously. Rumours of supernatural phenomenons and beings are taking over Europe. One of the most popular ones and is vampirism. Mr. Acker, a very wealthy and powerful man from London has put up an ad looking for vampire experts. Apparently he has been threatened by a vampire and the local authorities haven't been able to help him.  He offers £350 to whoever finds and kills the vampire. In today's money, it would be the equivalent of £36.000. </li>
            </ul>

    <h3>GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box right">
            <ul>
                <h4>Mr.Acker</h4>
                <li>David Acker or Mr. Acker is the son of a rich and powerful man in London’s society. His father was one of the higher ups at the East India Company until the company was nationalised. Most of the family fortune comes from the shady deal that happened when the shareholders voted to accept a pay-off for their shares. The family also has many other businesses and shares in other companies as well as board seats.
                    His father (Sir Edward Acker) died three years ago of tuberculosis. Since then the son has taken on all the businesses of the family.</li>
                <li>But Mr. Acker’s ambitions weren’t satisfied with just continuing the legacy, he wanted to be even more powerful and feared than his dad was. He started an iron factory in Birmingham to supply guns to the empire. He also acquired lots of properties around London and started importing exotic products from different regions of the world to sell them to rich european collectionists.
                    He is well connected to the UK’s government and has even some ties with the monarchy but as any powerful person, he has created many enemies along the way.
                    This time it seems like it has gone even further than a simple enemy: He has been receiving threatening notes signed with blood and letting him know that a vampire was onto him. Since then, Mr. Acker has stopped appearing in public and given the inefficiency of the police on finding the person threatening him and his family he decided to hire a team of experts along with some contacts to hunt down the vampire. </li>

                <h4>Mr.Graham</h4>
                <li>Mr.Graham is Mr.Acker’s right hand. They have worked together for many years. He is the equivalent of a dog of prey: aggressive, intimidating and feared. </li> 
                <li>He goes where Mr.Acker sends him and is in charge of getting things done and protecting Mr.Acker’s interests and honour. He has brutally beaten up more people than anyone can count and everyone is pretty sure that he has even killed. Mr.Acker always covers his tracks so he never gets in trouble. Mr.Graham is a man better not to mess with. He is a regular at many pubs but especially around Camden. </li>

    <h3>YOUR CHARACTER</h3>
    <div class="boxes">
        <section class="character-box">
            <ul>
                <h4>Victor Shaw - Ex-factory worker</h4>
                <li>Born and raised in the lap of a very low working class in Deritend, an area in Birmingham. Your life has never been anything special. You went to school, were an average student, had some friends, did some sports and once you were old enough you started working in iron factories. You got married and nothing else has happened since then… Until a month ago when you were told that you were fired. </li>
                <li>Mr. Acker (the owner of the company you worked for) decided to fire lots of people and the ones that kept their jobs had to work longer hours every day for the same pay. </li>
                <li>Now you are looking for a job and in the meantime you hang around pubs and with your old mates. </li>
                <li>A couple of weeks ago you heard that Mr.Acker had put an ad and a reward. Apparently he was being tormented by a vampire and needed vampire experts to help him. </li>
                <li>You didn’t know much about vampires but damn… with that amount of money you could retire! Still, it was a waste of time to go all the way to London for something you knew nothing about. </li>
                <li>Still, the idea of going stayed in your mind. A few days before the date for the “vampire experts meeting” you had a big night out and drank a bit too much. On your way home you found an old mate, Edwin Davies lying on the floor. There were fang marks on his neck and blood all over him. There was also a letter next to him. You were so drunk that it was very hard to read, but you are sure that you read the word vampire somewhere. You freaked out and went asking for help. You entered the nearest pub and told a few people. They followed you to the place where Edwin was but he wasn’t there anymore. They called you names and left you there after pushing you against the wall. </li>
                <li>The next day you were really hungover but still remembered that you saw your mate Edwin and you were convinced that vampires had killed him. Then you decided you had to go to London to find out more about vampires and maybe even claim that reward. You were still sad about your mate Edwin though. The poor bastard had lost his two year old son quite recently because he couldn’t afford a doctor to help him. That ended up with his wife running away, and rumours say that she left with another man. What a miserable life… Now killed by a vampire. </li>
                <li>But this opened an opportunity… You had seen the result of a vampire attack! Maybe this could be a sign? You had to go to London, attend that meeting and fight for the reward.  </li>
                <li><strong>You are not the vampire. </strong></p>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h5>Important information for your character: </h5>
                <li>- Once you get to the meeting in London, you will see your mate Edwin there. Then it will click in your head: He is a vampire. How? Why? And what is he doing there?  </li>
                <li>- As he is your friend (or was) and you also hate Mr.Acker, you will keep that information quiet and wait to talk to him privately at some point and tell him everything you saw. You have to convince him to trust you and somehow manage to claim the reward together without neither of you being killed. Try that no one sees you (nor hears you) have this conversation. </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h5 class="things">Your relationship with other characters: </h5>
                <li><strong>Edwin Davies</strong>: He is your mate. You grew up together in Birmingham and worked together in the guns factory. You found him lying on the street a few nights ago, having been attacked by a vampire. After that he disappeared and now he is at the vampire experts meeting.</li>
                <li><strong>Mr.Acker</strong>: He indirectly fired you. He is a cheap, evil bastard and you hate him. But he is offering a great reward so you have to put up with him. </li>
                <li><strong>Mr.Graham</strong>: He is Mr.Acker’s second in command but lately there has been rumours that he wants to sack him. A very violent and unpredictable man.</li>
                <li><strong>Jack Cooper and Eliza Evans</strong>They are gangsters from the city. They have bribed you a couple of times to give them guns from the factory. They also run pubs and gambling rings. Very shady and dangerous people but if you don’t mess with them they won’t mess with you. </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h5 class="things">Things you can say:</h5>
                <li>- You used to work at the gun factory until you were fired (you can tell the whole story). </li>
                <li>- You are here because you want the reward although you don’t know much about vampires. </li>
                <li>- You and Edwin worked together and are mates (make this claim from the very beginning).  </li>
                <li>- If anyone asks, you know that Edwin lost his son, and also that his wife ran away, but always defend his innocence if anyone accuses him. Lads have to have each other's backs. Also you don’t want to fuck around with a vampire.</li>


                <h5>Things you can't say (unless properly questioned or found out):</h5>
                <li>- You found Edwin lying on the floor and with fang marks on his neck. You thought he died but when you came back he wasn’t there. (Unless you are forced to confess. If people find out that it was you who found a body in the street you have to be elusive. Say you don’t remember. If they press say that you can’t say it. After a bit surrender and confess that it was your mate Edwin). Try to claim the reward if they make you confess.</li>
